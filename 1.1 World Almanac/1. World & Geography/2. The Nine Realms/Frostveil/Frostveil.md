## **Overview**

Frostveil marks where the known world fades into mystery, its northern reaches extending far beyond mapped territories. While its southern borders are clearly defined by Arborwyn's forests, its northern expanse remains unknown, with each expedition discovering new valleys, ancient ruins, and landscapes untouched by civilization. The realm's settlements cluster in the more hospitable south, but tales of what lies beyond—in the true north—fuel endless speculation and draw bold explorers seeking to push the boundaries of known Medir.

Survival here is not won through brute force, but through resilience, patience, and trust. The Frostborn value honesty, loyalty, and endurance, measuring a person not by their words but by their actions. To outsiders, they may seem cold and distant, but among their own, bonds are forged as strong as the ice beneath their feet. The region’s culture is steeped in practicality, tradition, and the understanding that hardship is best endured together, whether gathered in the warmth of a hearth-hall or braving the elements side by side.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

The Frostborn are shaped by the land they call home—quiet, unyielding, and unforgiving. They value loyalty, honesty, and quiet strength, believing that actions hold greater weight than words. Endurance is not just a necessity but a mark of character, and hardship is best met with stoicism and silent perseverance. Trust is slow to earn but unshakable once given, and betrayal is the one offense that is never forgiven. In a land where winter lingers and the wilderness is vast, the Frostborn know that a single misstep can mean death, and a single friend can mean survival.

### **Daily Life**

Life in Frostveil flows with the rhythm of necessity and survival, but also pulses with the warmth of close-knit communities. While hunters and trappers brave the frozen wilderness before dawn, the hearth-halls of settlements come alive with activity. Craftspeople work near roaring fires, turning raw materials into essential goods while sharing ancestral stories.

The working day is dictated by light and weather rather than time. In Glacier's Rest's markets, traders haggle over furs and herbs while sharing hot drinks. Fishermen in Driftbay battle icy seas during daylight, returning to taverns where sea-songs flow as freely as mead. Even in the coldest months, the Frostborn make work communal – from collective hunting parties to shared crafting circles in the warmest halls.

Nobility in Frostveil is pragmatic and few, with titles carrying expectation rather than privilege. House Vyrskald and other ruling families govern alongside their people, often leading hunting parties or managing trade themselves. Wealth is measured not in gold, but in provision, leadership, and fair judgment. Despite their reputation for cold efficiency, the Frostborn find warmth in their hearth-halls, where winter nights are spent in quiet camaraderie, storytelling, and shared meals. A raised glass or silent nod carries more meaning than words ever could. Hardship is met without complaint, and generosity is given without ceremony—survival is stronger when shared.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

The Tactician is honored as Frostveil's guardian, guiding hunters, leaders, and warriors who rely on foresight rather than brute force. Every expedition begins with a touch to their symbol, a silent request for strategic wisdom. The Seeker holds special place among rangers and those who navigate the unknown, representing both the pursuit of hidden truths and the wisdom of silence. The Reveler, seemingly at odds with Frostveil's austerity, is nonetheless beloved in hearth-halls where shared warmth cuts through the cold. The Luminary is revered as the light enduring through the longest winters, with frost-lanterns lit during polar nights to honor their guidance.

The Radiant Path holds a significant but subdued presence in Frostveil. Pilgrims travel to Dawnmere, one of the faith's most revered sites, seeking enlightenment among the tundra's stillness. Outside its walls, the Path's influence manifests in offering shelter, mediation, and aid rather than ceremony. Faith here is rarely spoken but always felt—a quiet, steady belief, like the ice that never melts beneath the deepest snowdrifts.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Hunt of the Silent Stag** _**(26th-28th of Crownglow)**_

As winter wanes, each Frostveil settlement selects their most worthy hunter for the realm's most prestigious challenge. These chosen few gather at Glacier's Rest before venturing into the thawing forests in pursuit of the legendary White Stag—a creature that moves in absolute silence, leaving almost no trail. For three days, hunters track this elusive quarry, maintaining their own ritual silence throughout. The White Stag's exceptional hearing makes it nearly impossible to approach, requiring unparalleled stealth and patience. When a hunter succeeds, they signal with a special horn carried only for this purpose. The size of the stag's antlers is interpreted as a prophecy for the coming year—a massive rack promises abundance, while smaller antlers suggest hardship ahead. In rare years when no stag is taken, communities prepare for difficult times, reinforcing storehouses and strengthening bonds.

### **Daily Practices**

Frostborn customs reinforce values without excessive ceremony. The Silent Toast—raising a glass without words—acknowledges respect between equals, while the Hearth Offering—placing a small portion of food in the fire—honors the land's provision. During harsh storms, households maintain the Watcher's Candle in windows, a practical beacon for travelers and symbolic reminder that none should face darkness alone. Frostborn rarely speak while hunting or traveling, using a sophisticated system of hand signals and environmental markers to communicate, conserving both energy and creating useful silence where necessary.

## **Economy & Resources**

### **Primary Industries**

- **Timber & Woodcraft:** Frostveil’s boreal forests provide hard, slow-growing timber, prized for shipbuilding, durable construction, and fine craftsmanship across Medir.
- **Hunting & Trapping:** The region’s vast tundras and forests are home to rare and exotic wildlife, making furs, hides, and preserved meats among Frostveil’s most valuable exports.
- **Alchemical & Herbal Trade:** The tundra’s unique climate produces rare herbs, fungi, and reagents, highly sought after for medicinal, alchemical, and magical purposes.

### **Trade Significance**

Frostveil is a vital supplier of durable timber, high-quality furs, and rare alchemical ingredients, exporting these goods to Arborwyn, the Crownsward, and Selmaris. Its trade is centered in Glacier's Rest, where goods are shipped along the western coast. Though dependent on imports of grain, textiles, and refined tools, Frostveil’s reputation for resilience, craftsmanship, and reliable exports ensures its place as a valued trade partner across Medir.

## **Founding Myth**

Frostveil’s origins are woven into the legend of The Whispering Glacier, an immense and ancient glacier believed to be sentient. As the first settlers braved the unforgiving tundra, they found themselves lost and near death, battered by relentless winds and buried under endless snow. In their darkest hour, a soft whisper—barely audible above the howling storm—guided them to safety. The voice, said to come from the glacier itself, taught them how to track elusive prey through the snow, where to find the rare herbs hidden beneath frost-covered soil, and how to endure the brutal winters without succumbing to despair.

In gratitude, the settlers vowed never to exploit the land’s secrets for greed, promising instead to live in harmony with its harsh beauty. They swore to pass down the glacier’s teachings through actions rather than words, valuing silence as a mark of respect and wisdom. It is said that the glacier’s whispers can still be heard by those who listen closely—the crackling of ice beneath one’s feet, the soft sigh of the wind through the trees, and the quiet hush that falls over Frostveil’s wilderness.

This myth shapes Frostveil’s culture to this day. Silence is revered, not as emptiness, but as a space where truths are revealed. Frostborn believe that the land itself is watching, and that every choice they make echoes through the icy expanse. Those who betray the land’s trust face not only the scorn of their kin but also the silence of the glacier, a fate more chilling than death. In every hunt, every harvest, and every oath sworn beneath the northern lights, the memory of The Whispering Glacier endures, whispering still.
