## **Overview**

Thornmarch sprawls across Medir's southern frontier, a vast territory where civilization maintains only a tenuous grip against persistent wilderness. The region's geography transitions from highland forests bristling with thorny undergrowth to the infamous Dreadfen Delta—an ever-shifting labyrinth of brackish water, deceptive ground, and primordial flora that consumes the unwary. Rivers carve deep channels through the landscape, their courses changing with seasonal floods and creating temporary islands that appear and vanish with unsettling regularity. This volatile terrain has shaped both the settlements and the people, producing communities that adapt rather than impose, surviving through knowledge rather than domination.

Unlike other realms where nature serves humanity, in Thornmarch, humanity serve nature's harsh lessons. The region produces no grand cities or sprawling farmlands, instead offering specialized knowledge and resources that command premium prices precisely because of the danger required to obtain them. From the scouts who map treacherous terrain to the alchemists who harvest deadly but valuable reagents, Thornmen embrace risk as the price of strength. Their society values demonstrated capability over birthright, creating a meritocracy where leadership must be continually earned through prowess, cunning, and endurance rather than claimed through inheritance alone.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

Thornmarch society operates by the fundamental truth of predator and prey relationships. Strength manifests in many forms—the hunter's patience, the scout's stealth, or the warrior's prowess—but all must demonstrate capability to earn respect. Honor revolves around reputation and obligation; oaths are sacred because breaking them destroys standing in a community where trust determines survival. Leadership follows natural law rather than birthright, with authorities maintaining power only through continuously proven competence.

The harshness of their environment breeds pragmatism over sentimentality. Resources are never wasted, lives are not taken without purpose, and even enemies may earn respect through displaying courage or skill. Death is viewed as transformation rather than ending—a necessary return to the cycle that sustains all life. This philosophy creates warriors who fight without hesitation but kill without malice, seeing combat as the natural test of strength against strength.

### **Daily Life**

For most Thornmen, daily life centers on practical survival skills. Settlements function as self-sufficient communities where hunting, fishing, and limited agriculture provide sustenance, while crafting focuses on utilitarian needs. Children begin learning survival skills early, with weapon training starting around age six. Communal meals reinforce social bonds while ensuring even distribution of resources.

Specialized groups create distinct subcultures. Trackers and hunters operate from frontier outposts, sometimes spending weeks in the wilderness. Alchemists maintain workshops filled with preserved specimens from the Delta, creating medicines and poisons that fetch high prices. Warrior societies organize into lodges based on fighting styles, competing for mercenary contracts throughout Medir.

The nobility of Thornmarch functions as military leadership rather than administrators. House Tarbraak and lesser houses coordinate defense, settle disputes, and claim tribute from successful hunts. Their authority derives from demonstrated capability—a leader who cannot maintain respect through personal prowess quickly faces challengers, creating a fluid hierarchy where status must be continuously earned.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

Four Ascendants hold particular significance in Thornmarch: The Tactician, The Arbiter, The Seeker, and The Torchbearer. The Tactician stands foremost, embodying the strategic patience that defines successful hunters and warriors. Her worship emphasizes careful planning and perfect execution over brute force. The Arbiter represents natural consequences—strength rewarded, weakness punished, and debts inevitably repaid. The Seeker guides those who venture into unknown territories, representing the courage to extract knowledge from danger. The Torchbearer embodies endurance through suffering rather than civilization's expansion.

The Radiant Path maintains minimal presence compared to other realms, with small temples in major settlements. Local practices focus on practical aspects of worship integrated into daily life—brief rituals before hunts, combat training, or dangerous expeditions. Prayer in Thornmarch tends toward specific requests for skills rather than contemplative worship, reflecting the pragmatic approach that defines the region.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Crimson Hunt _(22nd-28th of Mistcloak)_**

As frost claims the highlands, Thornmarch awakens to the Crimson Hunt. Warriors form hunting parties that venture into the realm's most dangerous territories, pursuing predators that have grown too powerful or numerous. For seven days, they track and bring down beasts that threaten settlements, culling dangers before winter while revealing who possesses the necessary skills to lead. In Brackenwatch, elders judge trophies not merely on size, but on the skill and respect shown in the hunt. Successful hunters earn leadership positions for the coming year, with their trophies prominently displayed as symbols of their proven worth.

### **Daily Practices**

Small rituals infuse Thornmen's everyday lives, reinforcing their values without formal observance. Hunters perform the Direction Ritual before departure, tossing three cut twigs to divine where prey might be found. Warriors touch weapons to the earth before training, acknowledging that all strength ultimately returns to soil. The Predator's Pause—a moment of complete stillness before important decisions—mimics a hunting beast preparing to strike. Meals begin with the eldest identifying which hunter provided the food, ensuring proper recognition of those who sustain the community.

## **Economy & Resources**

### **Primary Industries**

- **Specialized Hunting** – Providing rare pelts, bones, venoms, and trophies from creatures found nowhere else in Medir for alchemists and collectors.
- **Mercenary Services** – Supplying elite trackers, ambush specialists, and wilderness guides throughout Medir for dangerous missions requiring survival skills.
- **Alchemical Ingredients** – Harvesting unique plants, fungi, and animal products from the Dreadfen Delta for medicines, poisons, and exotic alchemical substances.
- **Trophy Hunting** – Guiding wealthy thrill-seekers from other realms on dangerous hunts, combining adventure tourism with practical skill-teaching.

### **Trade Significance**

Thornmarch occupies a unique economic niche within Medir, providing specialized products and services that cannot be mass-produced. Rather than competing with agricultural powerhouses like Amberfell or industrial centers like Ironholt, the region focuses on high-value, low-volume commerce where danger creates scarcity and scarcity ensures profit. This approach creates an economy where reputation matters more than volume—a single perfectly executed hunt might yield more wealth than months of conventional labor. The realm maintains selective trade relationships with the Ruby Cradle (supplying alchemical components), Amberfell (exchanging hunting expertise for food), and the Violet Spires (providing rare magical components). Thornmarch's position connecting to Solrest creates a vital trade corridor where goods, mercenaries, and specialized knowledge flow between realms.

## **Founding Myth**

In the forgotten times before Thornmarch had a name, a lone hunter wandered lost through endless wilderness, his strength failing after days without food. Near death, he encountered a massive blood-red stag with a hollow ribcage and eyes burning with otherworldly awareness. The beast spoke, offering a choice: "*Strike me down, and I will feed you. Spare me, and I will show you the way home.*" Desperate and starving, the hunter thrust his spear into the stag's heart.

In that moment, the stag fell to the ground and decayed to nothingness in an instant, and the earth shuddered beneath him, and the hunter realized his error—the stag had never been prey but a test, and he had chosen immediate survival over deeper wisdom. As he collapsed, expecting death to take him, the world turning black, the stag reappeared, transformed into a towering figure with bone antlers and eyes of distant fire. The entity placed a hoof on the fallen hunter's chest and whispered: "*Now you have learned.*"

The hunter awakened on high cliffs overlooking vast untamed lands of forest and marsh, surrounded by others who had faced similar trials. Each had heard the stag's voice in their dreams and understood its lesson: in this wilderness, they could establish their place, but only by respecting the hunt—knowing when to strike, when to spare, and when to endure. These first Thornmen swore themselves to the land's harsh balance, vowing never again to be prey, yet never wasteful in their hunting. From this covenant with the wild, Thornmarch was born, shaped by those who understood that true strength comes not from domination but from finding one's proper place in the greater cycle of predator and prey.
