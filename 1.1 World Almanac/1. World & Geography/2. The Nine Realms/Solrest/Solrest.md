## **Overview**

Solrest stretches across Medir's southern expanse, a harsh land where survival is not a birthright but a daily conquest. From the western foothills of the Brightshield Mountains to the eastern coastline of the Shimmering Maw, the realm is dominated by unforgiving desert and the relentless sun that has forged both its landscape and its people. The river Zalhir's Thread cuts through this barren territory, creating a verdant lifeline along which most major settlements cluster, while beyond its reach, only the hardiest nomads and most determined miners venture.

Where other realms might value tradition, diplomacy, or intellectual pursuits, Solrest celebrates strength, resilience, and self-sufficiency above all else. Its culture has been shaped by the harshness of the desert, creating a society where respect must be earned through action rather than words, and where weakness—whether physical, mental, or spiritual—is viewed as an invitation to ruin. This uncompromising ethos has produced some of Medir's most formidable warriors, shrewd merchants, and skilled survivalists, making Solrest a realm that others approach with both wariness and respect.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

Solfolk live by a single truth: "No one owes you survival." In a land where resources are scarce and danger abundant, strength is not inherited but earned through constant vigilance and fierce determination. Weakness—whether of body, will, or spirit—is seen as an invitation for ruin. To the people of Solrest, life itself is a battle against the unforgiving desert and those who would take what they have not fought for. This belief in earned strength doesn't make Solfolk heartless—respect is given freely to those who prove their worth, and loyalty, once earned, becomes unbreakable.

### **Daily Life**

Life in Solrest follows the rhythm of necessity, beginning before dawn when the heat is bearable and the real work of survival must be done. In cities like Shimmerport and Ferradin, markets bustle with activity as merchants bargain fiercely over goods, water distributors make their rounds with heavily guarded carts, and craftspeople work in partially subterranean workshops designed to remain cool.

For commoners, existence revolves around practical concerns: securing water, maintaining shelter against sandstorms, and contributing to communal defense. Laborers work in shifts, with the hottest midday hours reserved for rest in cool underground chambers. Children learn survival skills alongside basic education, with formal schooling focusing on practical knowledge rather than abstract concepts.

The warrior class forms a significant portion of Solrest society, with mercenary companies providing both military service and a path to social advancement. These warriors live by strict codes of honor centered on strength, reliability, and protecting what they claim as their own. House Khalvaris and other noble families maintain power through military strength, control of water resources, and strategic marriages. Unlike other realms, nobility in Solrest is not merely inherited—each generation must prove worthy of their position through feats of strength, cunning, or leadership. Failure can result in a family's swift decline, regardless of ancestral claims.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

The Tactician reigns supreme in Solrest, embodying discipline, foresight, and mastery over survival. Warriors, caravan masters, and strategists pay homage through careful planning and the honing of skills, believing that true devotion lies in preparation rather than prayer. Desert fortresses feature training grounds dedicated to The Tactician, where victories are carved into stone pillars as offerings more valuable than incense or gold.

The Reveler is honored not for excess, but for defiance against hardship, with feasts and celebrations serving as acts of resilience against the desert's cruel indifference. Even small settlements maintain a communal celebratory space where water and food are shared during times of bounty. The Collector appeals to merchants and leaders who understand that in Solrest, accumulation of resources often means the difference between life and death.

The Radiant Path maintains a presence primarily in urban centers, but its influence is limited by Solrest's practical spirituality. Religious observance takes the form of action rather than ceremony, with Solfolk believing that gods respect those who help themselves rather than those who merely offer prayers.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Thread's Bounty** _**(15th of Stormcrest)**_

When the full moon rises on Stormcrest's zenith, Zalhir's Thread reaches its greatest swell, bursting banks to reclaim the desert with life-giving waters. Warriors gather to perform the Flood Baptism, immersing themselves fully armed in the raging current—those who emerge are believed blessed with the river's strength for the coming year. Communities work together directing floodwaters through irrigation channels, temporarily setting aside rivalries for collective survival. As twilight falls, families place small clay vessels containing written ambitions into the water, watching as the current carries their aspirations toward manifestation. Water collected this night is considered sacred, preserved throughout the year for healing rituals, sealing important oaths, and blessing newborns.

### **Daily Practices**

Solfolk incorporate survival-focused rituals into every aspect of daily life. Many carry a small container of their homeland's sand, touching it before important decisions as a reminder of their roots and resilience. Warriors maintain a "life blade"—a personal knife never used in combat but essential for survival tasks, symbolizing the difference between fighting and living. Water sharing represents absolute trust—offering your waterskin to another creates an unspoken bond. When agreements are made, both parties place drops of water on heated stone, creating steam that "carries the promise to the sky." These practices reinforce the belief that survival depends on both individual strength and community bonds.

## **Economy & Resources**

### **Primary Industries**

- **Mining & Resource Extraction**: Yields obsidian, rare minerals, and alchemical compounds found nowhere else in Medir, with veins of heat-forged metals prized for their unique properties.
- **Mercenary Services**: Produces elite fighters who serve as bodyguards, military trainers, and shock troops throughout the kingdom, with specialized desert warfare techniques commanding premium rates.
- **Desert Alchemy**: Processes unique plants and minerals into medicinal compounds, dyes, and magical reagents that command high prices in markets across Medir.

### **Trade Significance**

Solrest controls vital trade routes connecting southern Medir with eastern markets, particularly through the Shimmering Maw and Ferradin's port facilities. Though resource-poor in conventional terms, the realm's strategic position and unique exports make it an essential trading partner. Primary exports include obsidian weapons, desert-forged metals renowned for their durability, and elite mercenary contracts, while imports focus on grain, timber, and luxury goods. The Steel Bank of Clan Svirask serves as both a financial institution and a trade facilitator, ensuring Solrest maintains economic influence disproportionate to its agricultural output.

## **Founding Myth**

Long ago, two mighty warriors waged an endless war across the barren lands: Zalhir, a brilliant tactician whose mind was sharper than his blade, and Amzakh the Red, a brute of unmatched strength. For years, their armies clashed without conclusion, leaving only dust and blood in their wake. Realizing neither could win through force alone, Zalhir devised a final gambit, tricking Amzakh's forces into turning against each other.

In the chaos, the two leaders met in personal combat. Their duel lasted seven days and nights, with neither gaining advantage, until both fell into a deep ravine, locked in a final deadly embrace. The next morning, where their blood had spilled, water began to flow for the first time—clear, swift, and life-giving. The desert itself had bent in recognition of their strength, opening its veins to form the river that would sustain all who came after.

This river, Zalhir's Thread, is said to whisper still to those who walk its banks, teaching the art of patience and strategy in the face of impossible odds. The Solfolk believe that like their land, greatness emerges only through conflict, and that true strength lies not in conquest, but in creating something lasting from struggle.
