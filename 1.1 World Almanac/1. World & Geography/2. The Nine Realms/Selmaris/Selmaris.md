## **Overview**

Selmaris commands a vital position along Medir's eastern coast, where the waters of the Sapphire Sea meet the continent. Its strategic location—nestled between the imposing Titan's Spine to the north and the prosperous Crownsward to the south—has shaped it into the kingdom's maritime gateway. The realm's varied coastline, from the rocky northern shores near Ironholt to the gentler southern harbors, provides natural havens for its massive merchant fleets, while inland waterways create an intricate network of trade routes penetrating deep into Medir's heart.

More than just a maritime power, Selmaris represents the pinnacle of mercantile influence, where fortunes rise and fall like the tides. Its strength lies not in raw resources but in the mastery of commerce, negotiation, and finance. Through its vast merchant fleets and sophisticated banking houses, Selmaris controls the flow of goods and wealth across Medir, turning simple trade into an art form. Its position facing the Jade Provinces across the Sapphire Sea has fostered a vibrant cultural exchange, evident in its small but significant tabaxi population and the eastern influences that color its ports and marketplaces.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

Selmarians believe that life moves like the tides—stagnation is failure, and adaptation is survival. Their world is one of shifting fortunes, changing alliances, and fleeting opportunities, where success is not just about wealth but about being in motion—always seeking the next venture, the next voyage, the next turn of fate. The sea shapes their philosophy: no one commands the ocean, but the skilled can ride its currents. This belief makes Selmarians pragmatic, resourceful, and bold, willing to take risks when the rewards are great.

### **Daily Life**

Life in Selmaris revolves around movement, commerce, and opportunity. Ports, markets, and counting houses bustle from dawn until well past nightfall, the tides setting the rhythm of trade. Unlike the rigid hierarchies of other realms, wealth and influence are fluid, shifting as quickly as fortunes rise and fall.

For the common folk, life revolves around the trade hubs. Dockworkers labor before sunrise, offloading cargo under the cover of night, while fishmongers, artisans, and scribes supply the merchant elite, knowing that one well-placed contract can change everything. The scent of salt, spice, and ink fills the air as deals are made with the ease of breathing, whether for a shipment of silks or the best seat at an inn.

The merchant class drives Selmaris's power structure, navigating a world of negotiations, investments, and political maneuvering. Birthright alone is not enough; wealth must be earned, expanded, and secured through shrewd business and alliances. The most successful own trade fleets, warehouses, and shares in multiple ventures, ensuring their fortunes remain intact even when one gamble fails. Where other realms might measure nobility by bloodlines stretching back centuries, Selmarians respect the house that closed three major deals this season—the past matters less than what one does with the present opportunity.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

The Merchant stands foremost in Selmarian devotion, guiding those who seek fortune through shrewd negotiation and calculated risk. Merchants touch coins to altars before finalizing deals, believing this ensures prosperity flows both ways. The Diplomat embodies political maneuvering and strategic alliances, invoked during negotiations where words hold as much power as gold. The Collector represents prosperity and exclusivity, honored by traders offering precious objects, believing wealth begets wealth. The Reveler reminds Selmarians that wealth means little unless enjoyed, with every major feast hall bearing their symbols.

The Radiant Path maintains a practical presence in Selmaris, with temples doubling as centers of commerce, law, and gathering. Clergy act as mediators of contracts and keepers of financial records rather than spiritual guides. Religious customs integrate seamlessly into business practices, social gatherings, and personal ambition rather than standing apart as formal ceremonies. Selmarians aren't traditionally devout, but they firmly believe fortune favors those who honor the Ascendants through action rather than mere prayer.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Tidefair Harbor Festival** _**(1st of Thawrise)**_

When the ice melts and trade routes reopen, Selmaris erupts into the kingdom's greatest mercantile celebration. The heart of the festival is the Great Market, where merchants who've stockpiled goods all winter compete in a frenzy of commerce across the harbor districts. Temporary stalls and bazaars fill every available space as traders rush to be first to move their wares, creating a spectacular tapestry of colors, sounds, and exotic scents. Ships depart with ceremonial banners while clergy bless vessels, contracts, and coin alike. A pervasive superstition holds that deals made during Tidefair carry special weight—those fulfilled bring prosperity throughout the year, while broken agreements invite ruinous fortune that follows the oath-breaker across the seas, turning even the calmest waters against them.

### **Daily Practices**

Selmarian daily life flows with the rhythm of trade and tide. Merchants tap ledgers three times before closing them—honoring past, present, and future transactions. Before important meetings, many perform the "Whisper to the Tide," turning briefly toward the sea to speak their intentions quietly, believing waters carry their words to favorable shores. Most Selmarians wear prosperity charms—often containing water from their first successful venture. In marketplaces, deals are sealed when both parties contribute a drop of water to a communal bowl, symbolizing how prosperity grows when shared rather than hoarded, while the phrase "may your sails never still" serves as both greeting and farewell.

## **Economy & Resources**

### **Primary Industries**

- **Maritime Trade:** Selmaris's fleets control the flow of goods across Medir, its docks and merchants ensuring nearly every imported luxury passes through their hands first.
- **Banking & Finance:** The realm's Counting Houses oversee loans, investments, and currency exchange, second only to the Steel Bank of Clan Svirask in Ferradin.
- **Shipbuilding & Navigation:** The shipyards of Vaelora's Watch produce Medir's finest vessels, while Selmarian navigators are sought after for their expertise in charting treacherous waters.

### **Trade Significance**

Selmaris is Medir's primary facilitator of trade and commerce, its vast network of ships and merchants ensuring goods flow efficiently throughout the kingdom. Though producing few raw materials of its own, the realm's mastery over shipping, finance, and negotiation makes it indispensable to Medir's economy. Selmaris exports primarily services - banking, shipping, and mercantile expertise - while importing everything from Frostveil's furs to Arborwyn's crafts. Its financiers are second only to the Steel Bank of [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/3. Factions & Orders/Regional Factions & Orders/The Nine Realms/Solrest/Clan Svirask]], and its merchants take pride in moving even the most challenging goods through dangerous waters. The saying "All roads lead to Selmaris" acknowledges that even landlocked goods eventually find their way to Selmarian ships and markets.

## **Founding Myth**

Selmaris's origins trace back to Vaelora, a merchant whose fortune began with a single gold coin and an unshakable wit. Arriving on the barren shores that would become Vaelora's Watch, she saw not what the land was, but what it could be—a hub of wealth, motion, and endless opportunity. Yet she knew no city could rise without the sea's favor, for the tides determined the fate of all trade.

One night, standing at the water's edge, Vaelora cast her last coin into the waves and made a bargain with the sea. She vowed that as long as her people honored the tides through trade and movement, the waters would bless them with prosperity and safe passage. But in return, Selmaris could never stagnate. The sea would take back what was hoarded, punish complacency, and ensure that no fortune lasted forever—for only through change could greatness endure.

The next morning, ships appeared on the horizon, drawn by unseen currents, bringing merchants, sailors, and adventurers who would lay the foundations of Selmaris's empire of trade. To this day, Selmarians honor the Bargain, casting a coin to the sea before setting sail, sealing a contract, or embarking on a new venture, believing that fortune favors those who keep their wealth—and their ambitions—always in motion.
