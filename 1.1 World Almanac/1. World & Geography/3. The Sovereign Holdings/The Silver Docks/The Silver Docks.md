## **Overview**

The Silver Docks stands as Medir's preeminent commercial powerhouse, a sprawling coastal metropolis where wealth and autonomy flow as freely as the tides. Built at the strategic confluence where the mighty Selway River meets the Sapphire Sea, the city commands unparalleled control over both Medir's inland trade and its international maritime commerce. Its distinctive skyline rises in tiers of silver-roofed warehouses, merchant towers, and guild halls, all connected by an intricate network of bridges spanning canals that serve as the city's primary thoroughfares.

Unlike other major settlements, The Silver Docks operates as a de-facto independent merchant republic within Selmaris's borders. Its vast wealth has purchased near-complete autonomy from noble oversight, with governance falling to a council of Merchant-Lords whose power derives from their commercial holdings rather than bloodlines. This unique position makes the city both integral to Medir's economy and somewhat removed from its politics—a place where coin speaks louder than titles, and even The High Forum treads carefully when dealing with the financial powers that reside within its gleaming harbors.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

The Silverfolk culture revolves around pragmatic opportunity—the belief that wealth is the most reliable measure of worth, and prosperity is available to anyone clever enough to seize it. Unlike nobility's emphasis on bloodlines or the Radiant Path's spiritual devotion, The Silver Docks celebrates material achievement and practical intelligence. The city's unofficial motto—"All tides lift worthy vessels"—encapsulates their meritocratic ideal, suggesting that prosperity is attainable regardless of origin, provided one has the skill to navigate commercial waters.

Practical knowledge is valued above theoretical understanding or artistic expression. The Silverfolk view magic with skepticism, considering it an "impractical fancy" compared to commerce and craftsmanship. This pragmatism extends to all aspects of life—relationships are viewed through the lens of mutual benefit, education focuses on applicable skills, and even religious devotion is approached as an exchange of offerings for divine favor.

Most distinctive is the elevation of contracts to near-sacred status. In a society where relationships are largely transactional, formal agreements provide essential stability. Breaking a properly witnessed contract isn't merely a legal violation—it's a profound cultural taboo that can render someone entirely unwelcome, creating an environment where shrewd negotiation is celebrated, but fulfillment becomes a matter of uncompromising honor.

### **Daily Life**

Life in The Silver Docks moves to the rhythm of commerce, with the day's pace set by the tides that bring ships in and out of its bustling harbors. For most citizens, dawn begins with the Market Bell—a massive bronze instrument whose toll signals the official opening of the Exchange Square for daily trading.

The city operates as a tiered society, both literally and figuratively. The Lower Docks swarm with laborers, sailors, and small-scale traders living in dense quarters. The Middle Docks house successful merchants, skilled artisans, and mid-level guild officials in neighborhoods featuring canals instead of streets. The Upper Docks, rising on the surrounding hills, contain the opulent estates of Guild Masters and Merchant-Lords, whose terraced mansions offer commanding views of the harbor below.

Despite these distinctions, social mobility remains a practical reality. Stories abound of dockworkers who became ship captains, or clever traders who rose to guild leadership through exceptional deals. This possibility of advancement creates a distinctive energy—a constant, calculating ambition that drives innovation and competition.

The true elite are the Merchant-Lords who comprise the ruling council. These individuals control vast commercial empires, maintain private fleets, and wield influence rivaling traditional nobility. Unlike hereditary lords, however, their position depends entirely on continued commercial success.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

The Silver Docks centers its spiritual life around The Merchant and The Collector, whose domains align perfectly with the city's mercantile character. The Merchant is particularly revered, with shrines at virtually every pier and marketplace. Before major transactions, traders leave small offerings—typically copper coins that accumulate until collected by the temple and redistributed for infrastructure. The Collector receives more formal worship in central districts, where temples serve as both religious centers and secure repositories for valuable contracts and records. The Diplomat and The Oracle also maintain significant followings among those engaged in international trade, with merchants seeking favorable negotiations and insights into market trends.

The Radiant Path maintains a pragmatic presence in The Silver Docks, adapting to suit the city's commercial character. Unlike grand cathedrals elsewhere, temples here serve multiple functions. The largest, The Argent Dome, doubles as the city's premier auction house, with religious ceremonies scheduled around commercial activities. Clergy focus on aspects of The Path that complement commerce—emphasizing honest exchange, prosperity shared through charity, and divine favor rewarding diligent work. Many Silverfolk practice "ledger faith"—a practical approach where religious obligations are treated like business transactions, maintaining personal "accounts" of offerings and attendance to demonstrate their commitment to divine principles in a quantifiable way.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Silver Flotilla _(9th-12th of Solargold)_**

At the height of summer, The Silver Docks transforms its harbor into a spectacular display of wealth and commercial prowess. Trading vessels are cleaned, repainted, and adorned with elaborate silver decorations and hanging lanterns, converting utilitarian ships into floating exhibition halls. For four days, merchant houses showcase their most exotic goods from recent voyages, hosting exclusive parties where potential investors and trade partners negotiate next season's ventures. By night, the illuminated vessels create a breathtaking spectacle as they sail in precise formation through the main harbor channels. The festival culminates in the Silver Count, where the Merchant-Lord Council ceremonially weighs silver collected from each participating vessel, with the most prosperous house earning the honor of leading next year's flotilla and receiving prime docking privileges until the winter solstice.

### **Daily Practices**

Small customs reinforce The Silver Docks' commercial character. Merchants touch coins to their foreheads before completing significant transactions, acknowledging The Merchant's oversight. When crossing one of the city's numerous bridges, travelers traditionally drop a copper coin into the water below—a ritual said to ensure safe passage and good fortune in the coming venture. Perhaps most distinctive is the "Tide Token" practice—when receiving change, Silverfolk typically leave the smallest coin on the counter, saying "For the turning tide." This small gesture acknowledges fortune's cyclical nature and suggests that small sacrifices ensure continued prosperity.

## **Economy & Influence**

- **Internal & International Trade** – The Silver Docks serves as Medir's largest independent trading hub, facilitating commerce between the kingdom and distant foreign markets.
- **Shipbuilding** – Specialized shipyards produce vessels optimized for long-distance trade routes, incorporating innovations from across the Sapphire Sea.
- **Economic Autonomy**: Though technically within Selmaris, the city maintains near-complete economic independence, with its own currency (the Silver Mark), banking systems, and trade agreements that operate independently of noble oversight

## **Founding Myth**

The Silver Docks began as three separate trading posts established at the mouth of the Selway River approximately four centuries ago. Captains Illiara, Morenthal, and Vash, representing different merchant consortiums, independently recognized the location's potential despite its treacherous approach waters.

Initially competitors, the three captains faced a common threat when a devastating storm threatened to destroy their fledgling outposts. Forced to cooperate for survival, they combined their knowledge of local currents and channels to save their ships and structures. This cooperation revealed an important truth: together, they understood the harbor's secrets completely, while separately, each held only partial knowledge.

Recognizing the strategic advantage of their combined expertise, the three captains formalized their alliance by establishing Foundation Pier—still standing at the harbor's center—and created the first iteration of the Merchant-Lord Council that continues to govern the city today. Their complementary skills in navigation, construction, and negotiation transformed a dangerous harbor into a thriving port.

This tripartite foundation remains reflected in the city's governance structure, where the Merchant-Lord Council always comprises sets of representatives from different commercial specialties—typically shipping, finance, and trade goods—ensuring balanced leadership that honors the three-fold vision of its founders.
