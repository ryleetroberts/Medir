- Repository for all items and artifacts obtained by The Violet Spires. Split into three main sections:
	- The "normal" vaults, with normal non-imminently dangerous magical items
	- The vaults for dangerous magical items or contained spells
	- The suppression chambers, for both magic objects and people posing an imminent threat.
