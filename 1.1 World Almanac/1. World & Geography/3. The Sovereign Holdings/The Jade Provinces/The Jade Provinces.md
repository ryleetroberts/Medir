## **Overview**

The Jade Provinces rise from the Sapphire Sea as a breathtaking archipelago of three major islands and dozens of smaller ones, named for the abundant jade deposits that have shaped their culture and economy for millennia. Once, certain islands represented the ancestral territory of a specific Tabaxi clan, though centuries of migration and political shifts have blurred these boundaries, with only the Lynx and Cheetah clans remaining on their historical islands.

Unlike the unified kingdoms of Medir, the Jade Provinces operate under a council system where clan loyalty and ancestral tradition define society. The High Council maintains independence through unmatched naval power, elite warrior traditions, and strategic alliances with both Medir's eastern realms and more distant nations across the Sapphire Sea. This position has made the provinces essential mediators in international trade, their ports serving as cultural crossroads where goods, ideas, and martial techniques flow freely between otherwise disconnected civilizations. The balance between the five great clans—each with their distinctive abilities and elemental affiliations—creates a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and traditions that has preserved their unique culture for centuries.

## **Culture & Society**

### **Values & Ideals**

The Tabaxi of the Jade Provinces live by a complex code that harmonizes seemingly contradictory virtues: fierce individualism with clan loyalty, reverence for tradition alongside innovation, and martial prowess tempered by artistic refinement. At their core lies "Spiritual Resonance"—the belief that each individual possesses an elemental nature that must be recognized and channeled for harmony.

Honor forms the bedrock of Tabaxi society, but differs from human notions. To a Jadecat, honor means authentically embodying one's true nature while respecting others' boundaries. This extends to both individuals and clans—each excels in their elemental domain without encroaching on another's expertise. Conflicts are resolved through ritualized challenges rather than warfare, though the provinces' history includes its share of clan conflicts.

Self-improvement through disciplined practice is a spiritual obligation. Whether in swordsmanship, calligraphy, or governance, Tabaxi culture demands excellence through relentless refinement. This dedication manifests differently in each clan—Tiger clan warriors seek the perfect strike, Jaguar navigators calculate ideal sailing routes, Black Panther scouts master stealth, Leopard architects create enduring structures, and Cheetah messengers memorize thousands of stories.

### **Daily Life**

Life in the Jade Provinces follows natural rhythms, with activities organized around seasonal changes and elemental flows. Dawn begins with meditation and exercise regardless of weather. For warriors, this means rigorous martial training; for artisans, preparation of tools; for scholars, recitation of ancient texts. Most Tabaxi begin their day with a purification ritual honoring their clan's element—Tiger clan members kindle a small flame, Jaguar clan members cleanse with water, and so forth.

Social structure combines rigid hierarchy with advancement based on skill. Each territory is governed by its clan's Domain Lord, with the Supreme Commander serving as ultimate authority over inter-clan matters. Despite this structure, talented individuals rise through demonstrated excellence, with competitions held to identify exceptional talents regardless of birth—creating a society where bloodlines matter, but ability matters more.

Cities in the Jade Provinces are arranged to enhance elemental harmony. The Tiger clan capital of Jinzaikei sprawls across volcanic plains with a central market plaza and training grounds positioned to harness thermal energy. The Jaguar clan's Ushiozaki is built around canals and tidal pools that seem to float during high tide. The Black Panther stronghold of Tsukikage is partially concealed within mountains, fully visible only during specific lunar phases.

Rural life centers around fishing villages, terraced farms, or specialized production centers. These communities maintain relative autonomy, with village councils handling daily affairs while acknowledging clan authority for defense and major disputes. Even the humblest village maintains a training hall and elemental shrine, reflecting the belief that spiritual cultivation belongs to everyone.

### **Religion & Spirituality**

The Way of Five Paths (Godomichi) forms the spiritual foundation of the Jade Provinces. Unlike the personified deities of the Ascendant Pantheon, Godomichi views divinity as flowing through five elemental forces: Chi (Earth), Sui (Water), Ka (Fire), Fu (Wind), and Ku (Void). Each has a primal spirit embodying its essence, but these are understood as natural forces rather than individual gods.

Each Tabaxi clan maintains a primary elemental affinity shaping their culture and practices. The Tiger-marked clan venerates Ka (Fire), embodying transformation and passion. The Jaguar-marked clan honors Sui (Water), reflecting adaptability and wisdom. The Black Panther-marked clan connects with Ku (Void), embracing mystery and potential. The Leopard-marked clan respects Chi (Earth), embodying stability and endurance. The Cheetah-marked clan celebrates Fu (Wind), expressing freedom and inspiration.

The Radiant Path maintains a modest presence in the Jade Provinces, primarily in port cities where trade with Medir is strongest. Pathbearers have wisely adapted to local sensibilities, incorporating elemental symbolism into ceremonies and acknowledging Godomichi as a "different path to similar truths." Major cities host small temples dedicated to The Merchant, The Diplomat, and The Oracle—Ascendants whose domains resonate with international trade needs. The Tiger clan maintains formal respect for The Radiant Path while ensuring it remains secondary to traditional practices, a compromise facilitating diplomatic relations while preventing religious tensions.

## **Traditions & Festivals**

### **The Five Harmonies Celebration _(10th-15th of Thawrise)_**

For six days culminating on the spring equinox, the Jade Provinces come alive with the Five Harmonies Celebration. Each of the first five days honors a specific elemental force with distinctive traditions: Earth Day features stone-carving competitions and ancestral honors; Water Day brings boat races and purification rituals; Fire Day showcases weapon-forging demonstrations and nighttime fire dances; Wind Day fills the sky with kites while poetry competitions and messenger races determine clan champions; and Void Day sees starlight divination and ancestral communion. On the final day—Unity Day—all five elements are celebrated together with inter-clan competitions, ceremonial marriages, and the renewal of peace treaties. Throughout the festival, clan boundaries temporarily dissolve as Tabaxi freely visit other islands, forming new friendships, trade partnerships, and alliances.

### **Daily Practices**

Small customs permeate daily life in the Jade Provinces, reinforcing elemental attunement and clan identity. Tabaxi greet each other with gestures reflecting their clan's element—Tiger clan members touch their fist to their heart, Jaguar clan members flow their hands like water, and so on. Homes feature small shrines with elements representing each family member's personal affinity, refreshed during morning rituals. Before important decisions, many Tabaxi consult elemental omens through practices like observing flame patterns, watching water ripples, or interpreting wind sounds through special chimes. Most distinctive is the custom of "elemental marking"—where Tabaxi use specially prepared pigments to enhance their natural fur patterns before significant events.

## **Economy & Influence**

- **Jade Trade** – The islands' abundant jade deposits form their economic backbone, with master carvers creating spiritual artifacts and luxury goods prized throughout Medir and beyond.
- **Naval Dominance** – The Jaguar clan's shipbuilding and navigation skills have established the provinces as the dominant naval power in the eastern Sapphire Sea.
- **Cultural Exchange** – Positioned between Medir and eastern lands, the provinces serve as cultural interpreters, facilitating diplomatic exchanges and providing trained bodyguards.
- **Specialized Agriculture** – Terraced rice fields, tea plantations, and unique medicinal herbs thrive in the provinces' varied microclimates.

## **Founding Myth**

In the dawn of creation, the five elemental spirits—embodiments of Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Void—sought perfect vessels for their essence. Each spirit discovered wild Tabaxi living in harmony with their element: fierce tigers near volcanic shores, swimming jaguars in coastal waters, steady leopards in mountain valleys, swift cheetahs on windswept plateaus, and mysterious lynxes dwelling in shadow-filled caves. The spirits marked these Tabaxi, transforming their fur patterns and granting each clan unique gifts that reflected their elemental nature.

Guided to the jade-rich islands, each clan established territory according to their affinity. For generations they remained separate, developing distinct cultures around their elemental gifts. The Tiger clan harnessed fire's transformative power, the Jaguar clan embraced water's adaptability, the Leopard clan embodied earth's endurance, the Cheetah clan channeled wind's freedom, and the Lynx clan explored void's mysteries.

Eventually, isolation bred conflict, and a great clan war erupted that threatened all they had built. As the islands trembled with battle, the five elemental spirits manifested at Mount Shirogane, revealing a profound truth: no single element could thrive without the others, just as no clan could prosper in isolation. They performed the first Element Festival, demonstrating how each element strengthened the others when properly balanced.

Understanding at last the strength found in harmony, the five clans formed the first Jade Court, establishing the foundations of governance that continues today. The elemental spirits returned to the natural world, speaking now only through the elements themselves and through the Path Masters who interpret these subtle messages. Though the clans would migrate and territories would shift over centuries, this founding lesson of elemental balance remains the heart of Jade Province culture.
