# **Medir: The Realms and Sovereign Holdings**

Medir is a vast and diverse kingdom, shaped by its landscapes as much as by its rulers. From the icy tundras of Frostveil to the golden fields of Amberfell, each realm has its own identity, culture, and role within the kingdom.

At the heart of Medir’s governance is the capital city Brighthold, where The High Forum resides. Here, noble houses, merchant lords, and religious leaders shape the kingdom’s future. Though all realms swear fealty to the crown, they each maintain a degree of independence, their rulers acting as stewards of their lands and people. Beyond these noble territories, Sovereign Holdings—autonomous settlements and locations—hold unique political and economic power, answering to no single lord but remaining vital to Medir’s stability.

## **The Nine Realms**

Medir’s Nine Realms form the backbone of the kingdom, each shaped by its geography, people, and purpose. Some lands are ancient and revered, their legacies woven into the kingdom’s history, while others are relatively ambitious frontiers still defining their place. Though all swear fealty to the crown, each realm governs its own way, contributing to Medir’s stability, trade, and defense. To understand Medir is to understand its realms—the heartlands of its power and prosperity.
