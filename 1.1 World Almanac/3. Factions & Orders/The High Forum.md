# **The High Forum, and its Structure**

## **Council Structure**

### **The Upper Council (5 members + The King):**
- Handles major governance, legislation, and high-level decision-making.
- Often convenes to address pressing issues of state, such as military conflicts, trade agreements, and city-wide policies.
- The King is a permanent member and acts as the chair of this body, ensuring continuity between the Sovereign Concord and Civic Circle.

### **The Lower Council (9 members + The King):**
- Oversees cultural, spiritual, and civic matters, ensuring the city’s day-to-day operations run smoothly.
- Focuses on issues like health, infrastructure, festivals, and arcane matters.
- The King also attends these meetings but plays a less central role, intervening when disputes or broader implications arise.

### **The High Forum (All 15 members):**
- Convenes for:
	- Seasonally scheduled meetings (once per season).
	- Emergency sessions to address city-wide crises or major decisions.
	- Decisions made here are final, as the odd number ensures no ties occur.
	- The King acts as the tiebreaker if a vote becomes deadlocked within the Sovereign Concord or Civic Circle, as his vote counts for two in those sessions.

### **Council Roles and Dynamics**
- Representation of the Ascendants:
	- Each councilor represents one Ascendant, embodying their virtues in governance. While not all councilors are devoutly religious, they all at least publicly uphold the values of their respective Ascendant.
	- While there are often Chosen on the High Forum, being on the High Forum doesn't mean one is Chosen!
- Balancing Power:
	- The King’s dual role ensures stability by linking the Sovereign Concord and Civic Circle. His extra weight in votes is a safeguard against gridlock.
	- The division between the councils allows for specialization, with the Sovereign Concord focusing on governance and the Civic Circle on societal needs.
- Decision-Making Process:
	- For routine matters:
		- Each council votes independently.
		- Majority rules unless the issue escalates to a full council session.
	- For major decisions or emergencies:
		- Both councils meet as the Full Council to ensure alignment and legitimacy.
		- The odd number of councilors prevents ties, ensuring clear outcomes.

### **Rotation and Tenure:**
- Councilors serve for life unless they resign, die, or are removed by a supermajority vote of the High Forum.
- Some seats have traditions associated with them, such as The Collector being almost always a Dragonborn, and the Oracle always being a seer or divination savant.

### **Selection Process:**
When a seat on the High Forum becomes vacant, a formalized selection process begins:

1. **Initial Candidate Identification**:
   - The vacant position's cabinet compiles a list of potential candidates from throughout Medir
   - Candidates may come from recommendations, institutional nominations, or self-nominations
2. **Cabinet Vetting**:
   - The departmental cabinet assesses all candidates based on qualifications, character, and alignment with the Ascendant's values
   - Regional representation and expertise are considered to maintain balance within the Forum
3. **Shortlist Creation**:
   - The cabinet presents 3-5 final candidates to the High Forum
   - Each candidate's credentials and vision for the position are formally documented
4. **Candidate Presentations**:
   - Shortlisted candidates are invited to Brighthold to present their qualifications
   - Current councilors question candidates on matters relevant to the position
5. **Forum Vote**:
   - The High Forum meets in closed session to discuss candidates
   - A simple majority vote determines the selection
   - The King's vote counts as two in case of a tie
6. **Investiture**:
   - The successful candidate is formally invested with the authority of their position in a ceremony honoring their Ascendant

Special considerations may apply for positions traditionally held by divine Chosen, and emergency situations may occasionally necessitate temporary appointments by the King until the full selection process can be completed.

### **Inter-Council Relations:**
- Councilors often form alliances based on shared interests, but ideological clashes (e.g., between The Arbiter’s rigid justice and The Healer’s compassion) create tension.
- Some councilors wield significant influence outside their roles, whether through wealth, military power, or religious authority.
- Councilors interact frequently outside of formal sessions, collaborating on overlapping domains and addressing issues directly within their areas of expertise. Nearly all of their actual work is conducted outside of meetings, emphasizing practical governance over ceremonial roles.
- Formal meetings serve as a space to discuss broader concerns, offer advice, and resolve disputes that require input from multiple councilors, ensuring alignment on major decisions.

### **The Bastion of Accord - The Seat of the Government:** 
- The Seat of the Forum - Western Wing
	- The Upper Chamber - The Upper Council's chamber 
	- The Lower Chamber - The Lower Council’s chamber
- The Grand Hall - Northern Wing, The High Forum’s grand chamber
- The Sanctuary of Counsel - Eastern Wing, the councilors’ office wing
