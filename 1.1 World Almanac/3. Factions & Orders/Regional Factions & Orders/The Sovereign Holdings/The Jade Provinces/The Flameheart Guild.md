An ancient guild of Tiger clan weaponsmiths whose blades are sought after throughout Medir and beyond. Guild members undergo decades of training in traditional forging techniques combined with elemental fire rituals, creating weapons with distinctive wavy patterns that are said to cut through armor as easily as cloth. The guild maintains strict control over their methods, accepting apprentices only after rigorous testing of both skill and character.
