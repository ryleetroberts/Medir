A semi-secretive order dedicated to tracking down and eliminating those who have committed grievous evils. Where others might show mercy, these grim warriors see only the need for swift retribution. They operate independently, often beyond Medir's borders, following trails of corruption wherever they lead. Members are recognizable by their stark black and gold-trimmed armor and the single crimson tear engraved on their weaponsâ€”a reminder that vengeance, though necessary, always comes from pain.
