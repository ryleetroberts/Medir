The most ancient of Sanctum Ardent's orders, tracing their lineage to elven warriors who first defended the mountain pass. They protect not just civilization but the natural world, seeing both as expressions of divine beauty worth preserving. Members adorn their armor with living vines and flowers, and many speak in proverbs drawn from natural cycles. The order maintains sacred plants throughout Sanctum Ardent, where even in the depths of winter, light and life thrive. They fight with unexpected joy, believing that defending beauty requires one to recognize and celebrate it, even in the darkest moments.
