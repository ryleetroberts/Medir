# **The Radiant Path**

## **Core Beliefs**

- Equality of Virtues
	- All virtues embodied by the Ascendants are considered equal, with no single virtue or domain holding supremacy. Worshippers are encouraged to embody all virtues as best they can, although naturally the most dedicated to The Path worship The Luminary most heavily.
- Divine Presence
	- The Ascendants are believed to be active divine forces, directly influencing the world and guiding their followers. Their blessings are sought through worship, and their wrath feared by those who stray from the path.
- Afterlife Beliefs
	- Those who dedicate themselves fervently to a single Ascendant are believed to ascend to that Ascendant’s divine plane after death, joining them in eternal harmony.
	- Those who worship the Ascendants collectively are sent to a general afterlife, a realm of peace and rest.
	- Wrongdoers or those deemed to have strayed significantly from the path are sent to realms of punishment, reflecting their failure to embody the virtues.

## **Practices and Rituals**

### Daily Practices:

Small acts of devotion are ingrained in the lives of the faithful, such as lighting candles, reciting short prayers, leaving offerings, or performing symbolic acts tied to specific virtues. For example:
- A craftsman might whisper a prayer to The Artisan before beginning their work.
- A judge might offer a brief invocation to The Arbiter before rendering judgment.

### Community Gatherings:

Regular worship takes place in grand temples and at local shrines, with gatherings often centered around a specific Ascendant or virtue. Seasonal festivals or holy days for each Ascendant are widely observed.

### Fringe Groups:

While the majority of followers adhere to the mainstream practices of The Radiant Path, small, radical sects exist. These groups often advocate for stricter adherence to one or more virtues or call for the rejection of outside influences on the faith.

## Organization

### Worship Sites:

Major Temples: Large, intricately designed places of worship where rituals and ceremonies are held. These temples often house symbols or relics tied to the Ascendants.

Shrines: Small, often simple structures or spaces dedicated to one or more Ascendants. These shrines are integrated into daily life, located in homes, workplaces, and natural sites.

## Hierarchy

### The Radiant One

Number: 1 

Role: The supreme leader and spiritual figurehead of The Radiant Path. The Radiant One is considered the voice of the Ascendants and holds ultimate authority over religious matters.

Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Atarah Aurelle]], who wields the Luminary's Ring of Radiance.

### The Guiding Stars

Number: 3

Role: The Radiant’s closest advisors and direct successors. These individuals oversee the most critical regions or aspects of the faith, including doctrinal purity, internal matters, external relations, and broad policy.

## Symbols and Imagery

### Primary Symbol

A 15-pointed star (pentadecagram) represents the Ascendants, with each point symbolizing one of the divine beings. The symbol is revered and often displayed prominently in temples and on ceremonial attire. It also serves as the emblem of the Luminary.

### Colors

White and gold are the faith’s primary colors, symbolizing purity, enlightenment, and divine favor. Clergy often wear robes or adornments in these colors.

Material:
Moonstone is the primary precious material used to symbolize The Radiant Path, in alignment with The Luminary’s symbolic material

In addition, marble is also commonly used, due to its white color and regal appearance, in alignment with The Radiant Path’s color symbolism.

## Interactions with Others

### Non-Believers:

Followers of The Radiant Path often view non-believers with a mix of pity and tolerance. However, more devout worshippers may see those outside the faith as misguided and in need of salvation. Zealots within the faith actively seek to convert others, sometimes aggressively. Other deities and pantheons are acknowledged as real, but The Radiant Path asserts that the Ascendants are the most virtuous and deserving of devotion.
