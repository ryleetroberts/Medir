# **Daughters of Ruin**

_“The law does not bind us, because we exist where the law does not reach.”_

The **Daughters of Ruin** are a secretive, highly disciplined faction operating in the shadows of **Medir**, formed from the **exiled noblewomen of House Carmivelle** after its political downfall. Once a **matriarchal house** renowned for its strategic marriages, diplomacy, and quiet influence over the royal lineage, House Carmivelle was **betrayed by rival noble houses**, accused of treason, and erased from history.

Forced into exile, the surviving **daughters, widows, and outcasts of Carmivelle** adapted, using their **political cunning, subterfuge, and intelligence networks** to reshape themselves into a faction that **now decides Medir’s fate from the shadows.**

## **Philosophy & Goals**

- **Balance Through Intervention** – The Daughters do not seek to rule; they ensure no ruler grows too powerful.
- **Enemies of The Arbiter** – They view The Arbiter’s inaction during their exile as proof that **justice is a myth.**
- **Correction, Not Rebellion** – They do not overthrow kingdoms; they **quietly remove individuals who threaten Medir’s future.**
- **Silent Influence** – Assassination is **not their only weapon**—they also use **blackmail, political sabotage, and deception** to maintain balance.

## **Structure & Leadership**

- **Matriarchal Leadership** – The Daughters are led by **a secretive council of Matriarchs**, known only to high-ranking members.
- **Strict Hierarchy** – New recruits must **prove absolute loyalty before receiving information about the faction’s true structure.**
- **Not Exclusively Women** – While **women dominate leadership**, a select few men serve as **spies, informants, or assassins.**

### **Relationship with Other Factions**

- **The High Forum** – Many within the High Forum fear them but refuse to acknowledge their existence, while others turn a blind eye, either out of pragmatism or necessity.
- **The Radiant Path** – The Daughters of Ruin sense deception within The Radiant Path but lack definitive proof of The Luminary’s imprisonment.
- **The Arbiter’s Chosen** – Considered **a failure of justice** and **an obstacle rather than a true force of law.**
- **The King’s Court** – Some nobles secretly rely on them; others fear becoming their next target.

### **Their Connection to The Stillness Beneath the Shadows**

- The **Daughters of Ruin did not seek out the Primevals**, but in their exile, they became aware of **The Stillness Beneath the Shadows.**
- Some **high-ranking Daughters are Bound to The Stillness**, gaining **unnatural stealth, the ability to move unseen by magic, and the power to manipulate perception.**
- This makes them **nearly impossible to track**—their enemies disappear, and no one remembers who took them.

### **Methods & Tactics**

- **Whispered Warnings** – Before striking, they often leave a cryptic note as a final chance for the target to correct their path.
- **The Hollowed Candle** – A half-burned candle left in a noble’s chambers—if they do not leave before it burns out, they never wake up.
- **The Widow’s Signet** – A cracked ring, once belonging to House Carmivelle, left behind as a message: _Your time is over._
- **The Last Letter** – A forged note in the target’s own handwriting, confessing their sins—often discovered just before their untimely demise.

### **The Players’ First Encounter**

- The players receive a **mysterious note**: 
	- *“The brightest lights hide the darkest secrets.”*
- Later, they **spot a scout leaving another message**—if they **kill the scout**, the Daughters **take notice.**
- Their **response depends on how the players handle the situation**, ranging from **a warning to a silent but calculated act of retribution.**

### **Quotes & Sayings**

- _“Balance is not given—it is taken.”_
- _“A noble who listens never meets us. A noble who ignores us never sees us.”_
- _“We are the unseen chain upon the throne.”_
- _“The dead do not rise, but we do not forget.”_
