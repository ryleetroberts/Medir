# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Mirielle Fenborn is not what most expect of a seer. Clad in weatherworn leathers and practical cotton rather than ceremonial robes, she speaks with the steady voice of someone used to braving swamps and storms—not reading omens in silk-draped towers. A woman of mystery, she emerged from the mists of the Dreadfen Delta with no memory of who she was, but with a mind honed like a hunter’s blade—and a gift that sees through time. She treats her visions not as divine riddles, but as tools. In the High Forum, she is a rare voice of pragmatism wrapped in prophecy: a Thornmarch-born wanderer with mud on her boots and futures in her eyes.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **The Three Truths at Council:** During her investiture, she calmly recited three private details from each councilor’s immediate future—none harmful, all true. The vote for her seat was unanimous
- **The Dreadfen Proclamation:** During her first year on the Forum, she warned of a flood in the Thornmarch highlands three days before the skies turned. Her foresight allowed villages to evacuate with no loss of life
- **Advisor in Quiet:** Known to meet with many members of the High Forum during early morning walks. What they discuss is never shared, but many policies seem to shift subtly after

## **Known Relationships**

- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Kaelen Varis]]:** Though their work is vastly different, Kaelen often consults her privately. Their bond is built on mutual instinct and shared understanding that truth isn’t always written
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Elara Windcrest]]:** The two women often align on matters of public well-being and approach problems with shared wilderness pragmatism
- **Often Keeps to Herself:** While respected among her peers, Mirielle rarely engages in council social events. Most who know her say she prefers the company of ravens and rain

## **Common Knowledge**

- **The Name 'Fenborn':** Not a family name, but one given to her by the Thornmarch locals after she emerged from the mists of the Dreadfen Delta. No one knew her real name—when asked, she simply said, “Call me what fits.”
- **Prefers Tonic to Wine:** Refuses the wine offered at formal council dinners. Instead, she drinks a bitter herbal tonic of her own making that smells like pine and swamp root
- **Murmurs While Thinking:** When deep in thought, she mutters half-formed questions aloud, as though in conversation with someone just out of view

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “A vision’s no use if it doesn’t put food on the table or boots on dry ground.”
- “The future’s a trail. Doesn’t mean it’s the one you have to walk.”
- “I don’t know where I came from. I know where I stand. That’s enough.”
