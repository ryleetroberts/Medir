# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Few figures in Medir command as much reverence—or apprehension—as Elya K’Arihim. Appearing unbidden at the gates of Sanctum Ardent clad in radiant silver plate and bearing the mythic Twin Swords of Judgment, her presence was taken by many as a sign of divine will. Though she remembers only her name, her celestial aura and piercing clarity of purpose leave little room for doubt. As the High Forum’s legal arbiter, she upholds The Arbiter’s will with unflinching resolve, embodying judgment that is neither cruel nor merciful—only precise. To the devout, she is justice made flesh. To the guilty, a sentence foretold.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **Bearer of the Twin Swords of Judgment:** Arrived bearing the legendary blades of The Arbiter, unseen for generations and widely considered divine relics lost to history
- **Codex Harmonium:** Unified Medir’s fragmented legal systems into a single, kingdom-wide doctrine, now regarded as the foundation of modern justice
- **Trial by Light:** Presided over the conviction of a corrupt Radiant Path official, publicly affirming that divine title offers no immunity from the law

## **Known Relationships**

- **Sanctum Ardent:** Deeply revered by the clergy and Justicars, who consider her presence proof of The Arbiter’s ongoing will in the world
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Marcos Orvessan]]:** Known ideological clashes with The Reveler’s Muse, particularly over the limits of personal freedom versus moral structure
- **King Aldred:** Though philosophically different, she holds the king’s respect and is often consulted in moments of grave decision

## **Common Knowledge**

- **Eyes of Judgment:** Her eyes emit golden light during pronouncements, said to compel honesty and make liars tremble
- **Never Unarmed:** The Twin Swords are always at her side—even within temple walls or council chambers, a quiet reminder of the law’s reach
- **Unbending Principles:** She does not negotiate rulings. Once a verdict is rendered, it is final—no matter the rank of the condemned

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “Justice is not vengeance. It is balance restored.”
- “When mercy serves only the cruel, it ceases to be a virtue.”
- “Speak truly, or speak not at all.”
