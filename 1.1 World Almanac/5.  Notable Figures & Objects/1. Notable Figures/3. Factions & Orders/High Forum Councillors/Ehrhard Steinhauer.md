# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Ehrhard Steinhauer is Medir’s master of stone, steel, and sweat—a self-made man whose calloused hands have shaped the kingdom’s roads, aqueducts, and skylines. Raised in the forges and shafts of Ironholt, his journey from orphaned apprentice to High Forum councilor is a rare tale of laborer's grit ascending to national prominence. Known for his unadorned speech and relentless work ethic, Ehrhard brings to the Forum a voice forged in fire and tempered by purpose. To the common folk, he is proof that dedication can build more than bridges—it can build legacy.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **From Orphan to Ironholt’s Renowned Smith:** Rose from a nameless child left at a mining gate to one of Ironholt’s most respected craftsmen—no small feat in a realm where lineage is everything
- **Innovator of the Ironholt:** Designed a new generation of mining tools and support systems that dramatically reduced cave-ins and equipment failures in Ironholt’s deepest shafts
- **Mastermind Behind Medir’s Modern Aqueducts:** Applied his expertise to reengineer urban water systems across multiple regions, improving access, sanitation, and efficiency

## **Known Relationships**

- **Miners of Sinderfell:** Grew up in a communal household of Ironholt laborers, many of whom still refer to him as “boy” with pride and affection
- **House Thaldural:** Though not noble himself, his innovations earned the formal recognition of Ironholt’s ruling house, who now consult him on major infrastructure ventures
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Cassius Calvessar Jr.]]:** Frequently clashes with The Merchant’s Ledger over budget prioritizations, particularly when economic interests conflict with public needs

## **Common Knowledge**

- **Wears a Blacksmith’s Pendant:** Always seen with a bronze medallion from his days as a miner in Ironholt, worn against his chest like a holy charm
- **Blunt to a Fault:** Speaks plainly, often to the discomfort of more refined councilors. When pressed for his opinion, he delivers it like a hammer blow
- **A Gruff Exterior, a Gentle Heart:** While famously gruff, those who’ve earned his trust describe him as deeply loyal, quietly generous, and almost embarrassingly kind


## **Memorable Quotes**

- “Build for the people who walk the road, not the lords who count the toll.”
- “If it can’t hold weight, it isn’t worth building.”
- “Talk less. Show more. That’s how you change a kingdom.”
