# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Marcos Orvessan is Medir’s song made flesh—a half-elf noble with laughter in his step and melody in his voice. From the courts of the Ruby Cradle to the wind-drum circles of the Jade Provinces, he has walked the paths of rhythm and revelry with unshakable joy. As The Reveler’s Muse, he serves as steward of festivals, culture, and collective memory through art, always guided by the belief that joy is not a luxury, but a necessity. Whether orchestrating kingdom-wide celebrations or lifting a room’s spirits with an impromptu tune, Marcos works to remind Medir that unity is forged not only in battle or law, but in music, love, and shared delight.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **The Performance that Won the Forum:** Instead of delivering the usual formal pitch to the High Forum, he performed an original piece combining Cheetah Clan drums and Cradle harmonics—many councilors described it as a moment of rare unity and catharsis
- **Reviver of Forgotten Traditions:** Personally revived and popularized ancient local festivals from fading villages, ensuring their customs live on in the national cultural calendar
- **Voice that Silenced a Storm:** During a drought-fueled civil tension in the Jade Provinces, Marcos led a days-long festival that defused political unrest and reignited hope through shared ritual and song

## **Known Relationships**

 - **House Orvessan:** Marcos is the youngest of four, born to Halvaren Orvessan and Sirelien Orvessan—respected jewel-box artisans of the Ruby Cradle. His two older brothers, **Talven** (age 45) and **Sereth** (age 42), continue the family craft. Though his path led away from the workbench and onto the stage, his family remains proud of the beauty he brings to the world in his own way
 - **Apprentice of the Cheetah Clan:** Trained under the master percussionists and breath-singers of the Jade Provinces, whom he credits with teaching him how to “listen to a people, not just a melody.” He returns often to visit, and their influence still colors his art
 - **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Raelis Kyrias]]:** Despite their wildly different temperaments, Marcos and the Archmage share a mutual respect—Raelis for Marcos’s instinctual insight, and Marcos for Raelis’s grounding presence

## **Common Knowledge**

- **Always Humming Something:** Whether in council or walking the streets, he often hums half-finished tunes under his breath—many of them become formal compositions later
- **Laughs Easily, Cries Quietly:** Known for his open displays of joy and affection, but heartbreaks—personal or political—hit him deeply. When a cultural site is destroyed or a festival is canceled, he takes it personally
- **Avoids Conflict When Possible:** Dislikes shouting, cold calculations, or harsh rulings. Even in tense council debates, he’ll attempt levity first—and deflection second

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “A song shared is a burden halved.”
- “Let them dance. Let them laugh. We’ll find our way forward better with both.”
- “There’s always time for one more verse.”
