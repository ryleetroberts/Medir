# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Elara Windcrest, known formally as the **Healer’s Patron**, speaks for the virtues of mercy, restoration, and resilience upon the High Forum. She hails from the frost-hardened reaches of northern Frostveil, where healing is not an art of gentle temples, but a matter of life wrested from death with raw hands and stubborn will. Though not a priestess, her work bears the blessing of The Healer, woven into salves, poultices, and whispered rites at bedside. Stern and pragmatic, Elara’s calling is not to noble halls, but to muddy roads, frostbitten villages, and war camps where the breath still steams from dying lungs.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **Breaker of the Iceborn Curse:** When a wasting illness crept across the north like a slow frost, Elara and her husband Thorne crafted an herbal remedy that burned it out before it could take root across Medir’s heartlands
- **Steward of Wardcraft and Watchfulness:** Spread the teaching of simple woundcraft, warding sigils, and seasonal herbal brews to remote hamlets and keepfasts—methods that stilled plagues before they bloomed
- **Unifier of the Healers' Orders:** Codified field practices between temple healers, hedge-alchemists, and knightly medica, so that all who treat the sick speak one tongue and trust one touch

## **Known Relationships**

- **Thorne Windcrest:** Her husband, a reclusive herbalist of Thornmarch. Together, they bridge two wild traditions—his rooted in swamp and shadowed fen, hers in frost and stone
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Kaelen Varis]]:** A kindred soul on the Forum. Both share a distaste for delay, and have more than once pushed forward crisis measures while others were still debating tone
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Cassius Calvessar Jr.]]:** Frequently at odds. While she concedes that coin buys bandages, she refuses to let profit dictate who lives and who does not

## **Common Knowledge**

- **The Satchel Never Leaves Her Side:** Whether in the Forum chamber or atop a wind-wracked cliff village, Elara carries her weathered healer’s satchel, stocked with poultices, gauze, and vials of tonics
- **Still Sleeps Light:** Known to rise before dawn to walk the outer halls of Brighthold’s infirmary, checking on patients personally when the halls are still quiet
- **Wears Her Homeland Proud:** Her practical garb, bound in layers of wool, leather, and the signs and colors of Frostveil, marks her not as a noble, but as one who walks among the wounded

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “The wound does not care how noble the blood.”
- “Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is not speak. Just listen. And let them know they are not alone.”
- “Compassion without action is just sentiment dressed in silk.”
