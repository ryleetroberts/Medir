# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Professor Alaric Greymist serves as the Scholar’s Sage on the High Forum, a role he’s held longer than most of Medir’s current rulers have been alive. A high elf known for his methodical mind and piercing logic, Alaric approaches governance not through magical might but through intellectual discipline and the careful analysis of history, law, and thought. Though capable of arcane practice, he rarely relies on it—preferring logic to spectacle, reason to force. Often underestimated due to his eccentric demeanor, Alaric remains one of the Forum’s most respected (and occasionally exasperating) voices.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **Longest-Serving Member of the High Forum:** A source of continuity and memory across changing monarchs and crises
- **Advisor to Multiple Crowns:** His counsel has guided more than one ruler through political storms, always from the perspective of history and logic
- **Trusted During Magical Crises:** Despite not being a primary practitioner, his knowledge has proven vital in assessing arcane threats and proposing rational countermeasures

## **Known Relationships**

- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Raelis Kyrias]]:** A close personal friend and frequent collaborator. While Raelis focuses on arcane application, Alaric provides historical, philosophical, and logical context to guide magical policy
- **King [[1. World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Aldred Caelric|Aldred Caelric]]:** The King often turns to Alaric when faced with precedent or complex historical parallels
- **The Radiant [[1. World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Atarah Aurelle|Atarah Aurelle]]:** Their relationship is formally cordial. Alaric is known for quietly challenging dogma with questions rather than confrontation

## **Common Knowledge**

- **Razor-Sharp Logic:** While not confrontational, Alaric has an uncanny ability to dismantle weak arguments with a single question.
- **Not a Magus:** Though he occasionally demonstrates arcane capability, most agree he’s more scholar than spellcaster
- **Aloof, Even a Bit Odd:** Often seems distracted, muttering to himself or scribbling mid-conversation. Some joke that he’s forgotten more than most people ever learn—and that he forgot it on purpose.
- **Unassuming… Until Provoked:** Appears harmless and vaguely eccentric—right up until someone underestimates him in debate or disrespects the value of knowledge. Then, his words turn precise, merciless, and unforgettable.

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “An idea, once questioned properly, either sharpens or dissolves.”
- “Knowledge is never forbidden in Medir. Sometimes we just misplace it, quietly.”
- “Magic and might may shape the world, but it is knowledge that decides what shape it takes.”
