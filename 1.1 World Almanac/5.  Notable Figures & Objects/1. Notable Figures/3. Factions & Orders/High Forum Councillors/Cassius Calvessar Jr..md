# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

At just twenty-seven, Cassius Calvessar Jr. is the youngest sitting member of the High Forum, holding the title of The Merchant’s Ledger. As the voice of Selmaris and steward of Medir’s trade policy, Cassius represents the sharp edge of commerce—elegant, efficient, and never off balance. Raised within the wealth and ambition of the Calvessar dynasty, he blends charm with calculation, turning market trends into political leverage and conversation into quiet contracts. Though his rise was bolstered by his family’s reach, few question that he’s earned his place—and intends to rise further.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **Raised from the Deck, Not the Drawing Room:** Though born to wealth, Cassius spent his youth aboard trading ships, gaining firsthand experience with foreign markets before ever setting foot in a counting house
- **Youngest Forum Appointment in Over a Century:** Appointed at twenty-four years old after impressing the Forum with his command of international markets—though it didn’t hurt that Selmaris’s merchant guilds backed him unanimously
- **Broker of Modern Trade Policy:** Led the restructuring of Medir’s inter-realm tariff system, balancing regional needs without triggering trade wars
- **Revitalized the Ferradin Exchange:** Helped standardize currency exchange across multiple realms, securing Medir’s status as a financial hub in the wider world

## **Known Relationships**

- **The Calvessar Family:** Eldest son of Lord Cassius Calvessar Sr., the former Merchant’s Ledger, and Lady Selene Calvessar, a respected political strategist in Selmaris. He has a younger sister, Lysette (23), active in diplomatic circles, and twin brothers, Dorian and Marek (17), currently studying finance in Ferradin
- **King [[1. World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Aldred Caelric|Aldred Caelric]]:** Maintains a respectful relationship, though their values sometimes diverge—Aldred favors caution, while Cassius embraces calculated risk
- **[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/5.  Notable Figures & Objects/1. Notable Figures/3. Factions & Orders/High Forum Councillors/Kaelen Varis]]:** Their interactions are rare but pointed—Kaelen mistrusts how easily Cassius turns virtue into currency

## **Common Knowledge**

- **Polished, But Not Passive:** Cassius’s charm disarms even skeptical nobles, but those who mistake him for soft quickly discover the steel beneath the smile
- **Talks Like a Merchant, Thinks Like a Strategist:** Known for breaking down economic policy with elegant metaphors—then quietly structuring the room’s funding so everyone owes him a favor
- **Wears Wealth Lightly:** His clothes are stylish but never ostentatious, favoring fine tailoring over jewels. As he once quipped: _“If they can see the gold, I’ve already lost the deal.”_

## **Memorable Quotes**

- “Every decision is a transaction. Even silence has cost.”
- “We don’t punish ambition in Selmaris—we give it a budget.”
- “The world isn’t ruled by coin. It’s ruled by whoever holds the pen when the deal is written.”
