# **`=this.file.name`**
## **Overview**

Lord Tharivol Feloran embodies the exquisite extravagance of The Ruby Cradle, his very presence a testament to the region's dedication to beauty without restraint. As head of House Feloran and ruler of the realm, he has transformed what others might view as frivolous luxury into a powerful economic and cultural force within Medir. His long fingers—adorned with no fewer than twelve enchanted rings at any given time—craft jewelry coveted by royalty across continents, pieces that blend magical utility with aesthetic brilliance. When he speaks in council meetings, he does so with the measured deliberation of an artisan examining a flawed gem, his Ruby Cradle cadence and unexpected bursts of creative terminology often leaving other councilors momentarily bewildered yet ultimately enlightened. Despite his occasionally bewildering eccentricities and unabashed elitism regarding matters of taste, his genuine mastery of craft and decades of experience make him an invaluable voice on the High Forum.

## **Notable Accomplishments**

- **The Feloran Collection**: Created a legendary series of enchanted jewelry pieces now worn by high society across Medir, each meticulously crafted serving as a visible symbol of their position. These masterworks are considered the finest magical jewelry created in the modern era.
- **The Harmonious Confluence**: Pioneered revolutionary techniques for embedding multiple enchantments within a single piece of jewelry without conflict or interference, a magical breakthrough that has applications far beyond adornment, including enhancements to diplomatic tools, healing devices, and defensive artifacts.
- **The Arboran-Cradler Accord**: Negotiated a landmark trade agreement with Arborwyn, securing the Ruby Cradle's access to rare enchantment-receptive woods from the ancient forests. This treaty has enabled the creation of wooden components that enhance magical jewelry and artifacts, combining the strengths of both realms' natural resources.


## **Known Relationships**

- **House Feloran**: Rules his family with the same precision he applies to gemcutting, maintaining strict standards for his relatives' public behavior and artistic contributions. His wife, Lady Elanil Feloran, is a renowned enchantress whose magical abilities complement his craftsmanship. Their twin children—son Vaelorin and daughter Vaelariel—are being groomed as the next generation of artisan-nobility, each already showing promise in different aspects of the family's artistic legacy.
- **The Gemcutters' Guild**: Serves as the honorary lifetime patron of this powerful trade organization that controls much of the gem and precious metals market throughout Medir, using his influence to ensure guild members receive proper recognition and compensation for their work.
- **Lady Selene Calvessar**: His most valued client among Selmaris's elite and occasionally fierce critic of his more outlandish design choices. Their playful public disagreements about aesthetic theory have become a regular feature of seasonal galas, with observers often unable to determine whether their rivalry is genuine or elaborate performance.

## **Common Knowledge**

- **The Feloran Test**: Presents visitors to his court with seemingly simple objects—cups, walking sticks, or decorative items—secretly observing how they handle them. Unbeknownst to guests, these items are actually exquisite artworks or ancient treasures; their treatment reveals volumes about the visitor's appreciation for craftsmanship.
- **Jeweled Speech**: Peppers his conversation with peculiar terminology drawn from gemcutting and jewelry-making, referring to people as "unpolished specimens" or "flawless examples," while describing ideas as "well-faceted" or "lacking proper setting." This specialized vocabulary often leaves non-Ruby Cradle natives bewildered.
- **The Midnight Workshop**: Despite his exalted position, still spends most nights working in his private studio, where even after centuries of mastery, he claims to be "merely a student of beauty," creating pieces that sometimes never leave his workshop if they fail to meet his exacting standards.

## **Memorable Quotes**

- "The Ruby Cradle understands what others forget—that extravagance, properly directed, is not wastefulness but rather the fullest expression of potential."
- "How peculiar that other nobles consider it strange to master one's own craft. Would you respect a ruler of shipwrights who had never built a vessel? I rule jewelers and artisans—what kind of leader would I be if I could not create beauty with my own hands?"
- "I find your lack of embellishment... refreshingly minimalist. Though perhaps a small ruby accent would not be entirely unwelcome? No? How delightfully austere of you."
