# **The Chosen: Mortals Elevated by The Ascendants**

## **Overview**

### **Definition**

The Chosen are mortals selected by the Ascendants and granted divine power, serving as a bridge between the mortal and divine realms. While they remain fully mortal, they are touched by the divine, bearing abilities that set them apart from others. Some are seen as extensions of their Ascendant’s will, while others are granted power with no direct obligation—only the knowledge that they have been elevated beyond their peers.

Unlike monks, rulers, or religious figures who dedicate their lives to service, The Chosen are not appointed by institutions or mortals, nor do they earn their title through devotion alone. Instead, their selection is at the sole discretion of their patron Ascendant, chosen through divine insight rather than through mortal approval. A Chosen might be a devout follower, but they could just as easily be an atheist, an outlaw, or someone completely unaware of the Ascendants’ greater plan.

Throughout history, The Chosen have been warriors, scholars, kings, wanderers, revolutionaries, and even villains. Some serve the world openly, shaping nations and cultures, while others exist in secrecy, their deeds known only to a few. Whether revered or feared, they remain a testament to the power of the Ascendants and their continued presence in the mortal world.

### **Purpose**

The Ascendants do often not walk among mortals, nor do they act directly upon the world. Instead, their influence is felt through faith, symbols, and those they elevate—The Chosen.

The purpose of The Chosen is not universally defined. Some act as extensions of their Ascendant’s will, shaping the world in ways their patron deems necessary. Others simply reflect their Ascendant’s domain, blessed for their alignment with divine ideals rather than for any direct mission. While some Chosen dedicate themselves fully to their patron, others walk their own path, influenced but not bound by their selection.

Regardless of their role, The Chosen are living proof of the Ascendants’ presence, reminders that the divine still touches the world. Their actions—intentional or not—often shape the course of history, leaving behind legacies of faith, conflict, and transformation.

## **Selection & Calling**

### **Becoming Chosen**

There is no singular path to becoming one of The Chosen. Some are selected at the height of their achievements, while others receive their calling before they have proven themselves to the world. A Chosen may be a renowned warrior, a masterful scholar, a ruler of great wisdom, a humble artisan, a forgotten exile, or even a child whose future has yet to be written. Some are paragons of their domain; others are outliers, seemingly at odds with what their patron represents—until time reveals why they were selected.

Unlike mortal titles, The Chosen cannot be appointed by rulers, nor can their status be inherited, purchased, or earned through devotion alone. Many seek to prove themselves worthy, but it is the Ascendant alone who decides who is chosen and when.

Regardless of when or why they are chosen, all Chosen are made aware of their selection. Some experience a direct manifestation of their patron, standing before them in a moment of undeniable clarity. Others receive their calling through a vision, an overwhelming sense of purpose, or a moment of divine transformation. For some, the revelation is gentle, a whispered truth settling into their soul. For others, it is earth-shattering—a moment that redefines the course of their life in an instant.

No matter how it happens, a Chosen always knows. And from that moment forward, whether they embrace their fate or struggle against it, they can never return to the life they once had.

### **The Process of Selection**

Each Ascendant selects their Chosen according to their nature and philosophy, but even within a single Ascendant’s selections, the reasoning and expectations can vary. Some Chosen are expected to be champions of divine will, while others are given power with no direct expectation of service.

For some Ascendants, the act of being Chosen is a sacred duty, with their Chosen seen as direct agents of their influence. These individuals may be expected to uphold their patron’s ideals, shape the world in their image, or serve as a symbol of their domain. Others grant their power freely, with no demands—some Chosen may never feel obligated to act on their patron’s behalf, while others may interpret their selection as a divine calling.

Even among an Ascendant’s own choices, the criteria are not always rigid. A single Ascendant may choose one individual for their unwavering dedication and another simply for their raw talent or ambition. One Chosen may be granted power to carry out a divine purpose, while another may be chosen simply because their existence aligns with the Ascendant’s nature.

The frequency of selection also shifts with circumstance, necessity, and divine will. Some Ascendants choose sparingly, centuries passing before they find one worthy of their power. Others always have multiple Chosen at any given time, ensuring their influence is never absent from the world. Some select only a single Chosen at a time, while others elevate several with vastly different roles and expectations.

Because of this variance, no universal pattern dictates when a Chosen will emerge, how they will serve, or how they will be perceived. Some rise as beacons of faith, others as hidden forces of change. Regardless of the manner of their selection, all Chosen serve as a reminder that the Ascendants remain ever-present, watching and shaping the world through those they elevate.

## **Status & Influence**

### **A Divine Class**

The Chosen stand apart from ordinary mortals, not through birthright or wealth, but by the undeniable touch of the Ascendants. Though they remain mortal in flesh, they exist above their peers, elevated by divine favor.

Yet, their status is not uniform—some Chosen rise to great renown, while others remain nearly unknown. In many cultures, they are viewed as living proof of the Ascendants’ presence, their existence reinforcing faith and shaping the spiritual fabric of society. Some are revered as sacred figures, akin to prophets, saints, or divine champions. Others are feared or envied, their power making them figures of myth, mystery, or even controversy.

Unlike rulers who inherit their authority or priests who rise through doctrine, The Chosen are neither appointed nor replaceable. A Chosen is singular, their presence in the world a testament to the will of the divine. This status often places them above even the most powerful mortals in terms of influence—though influence does not always mean control.

Because their selection is beyond mortal governance, some rulers, religious leaders, and organizations struggle to integrate The Chosen into their existing hierarchies. Some embrace them as divine agents, while others seek to limit their influence or even suppress knowledge of their existence. Regardless of where they stand in mortal society, one truth remains—to be Chosen is to walk a path few can ever understand, carrying a burden that is both a gift and a weight upon the soul.

### **Perception in Society**

The Chosen exist outside the bounds of mortal institutions, yet their presence inevitably shapes the world around them. Their perception varies widely across cultures, religions, and political landscapes—revered, feared, envied, or resented, depending on who tells the story.

In some realms, The Chosen are celebrated as sacred figures, their names etched into scripture and legend. They are treated as messengers of the divine, their words carrying unquestionable weight among rulers and the faithful alike. Statues and temples may be raised in their honor, their deeds immortalized in art, song, and myth.

Elsewhere, they are regarded with unease—powerful, but disruptive. Some rulers see them as challenges to mortal authority, figures beyond control who answer only to the Ascendants. Religious leaders may debate whether The Chosen are blessed figures to be obeyed or dangerous individuals whose influence must be carefully managed. In some cases, Chosen who do not conform to societal expectations are feared, exiled, or even hunted—a mortal response to a force beyond mortal understanding.

For the common people, The Chosen can be symbols of hope or omens of change. Some inspire faith and courage, their presence seen as proof that the Ascendants still watch over the world. Others are whispered about with caution, for where a Chosen walks, the will of an Ascendant follows—and that will does not always favor stability.

### **Variations in Renown**

Not all Chosen walk the world in legend. While some stand as beacons of faith, warfare, or governance, their names known across kingdoms, others move unseen, their influence felt but never traced back to them. There is no single way to be Chosen, and there is no single way to be remembered.

Some Chosen are immediately recognized, their gifts undeniable—miracles performed before crowds, their abilities too great to ignore. They may become icons of faith, leaders of nations, or champions of war, their names carried by history itself. Others deliberately place themselves in the public eye, wearing their status openly, adopting the symbols of their patron Ascendant and ensuring their deeds are recognized.

Others, however, choose—or are forced—to remain hidden. A Chosen of The Seeker may live in shadows, their influence known only through whispers and half-truths. A Chosen of The Diplomat may shape history not through battle or conquest, but through quiet conversations that shift the course of nations. Some Chosen simply prefer an ordinary existence, embracing their gifts but not the fame that often follows them.

Because of this, there is no universal symbol that marks a Chosen. While many choose to display the insignia, colors, or symbols of their Ascendant, there is no singular trait that reveals their status to the world. Some of their powers are immediately visible, such as a Chosen of [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] whose presence illuminates the darkness, while others wield more subtle gifts, their abilities no more outwardly visible than the natural talents of any skilled mortal.

Whether their names are immortalized in legend or lost to time, all Chosen leave a mark on the world. Even those who move in secrecy shape history in ways unseen, their presence felt even if their identity is forgotten.

## **Powers & Mortal Limits**

### **Boons of The Ascendants**

The power of The Chosen is not their own—it is a gift, a mark of favor from their patron Ascendant. These divine blessings, known as Boons, manifest in many ways, reflecting both the nature of the Ascendant who granted them and the individual abilities of the one who receives them.

Some Chosen wield awe-inspiring, unmistakable power, their abilities shaping battlefields, altering fate, or healing the gravely wounded. Others possess more subtle gifts, where divine favor enhances their natural talents, sharpening their minds, their words, or their instincts beyond mortal limits. No two Boons are identical—even Chosen of the same Ascendant may manifest their gifts differently.

The manner in which these Boons are wielded varies greatly. Some Chosen learn to control their abilities swiftly, wielding them with precision from the moment of their selection. Others struggle, their divine gifts awakening gradually as they come to understand their purpose. Some never fully master their abilities, wielding their Boons instinctively rather than through careful study.

Boons are not limitless. A Chosen does not wield the full might of an Ascendant, nor do they possess inexhaustible power. The divine energy they channel must be tempered by mortal limitations—drained through effort, exhaustion, and even doubt.

Though varied in form and function, Boons are what separate The Chosen from all others. Whether through divine magic, supernatural talent, or impossible intuition, their gifts mark them as something more than mortal—even as they remain mortal at their core.

### **Mortality of the Chosen**

Despite their divine gifts, The Chosen remain mortal. They can be wounded, they can fall to sickness or age, and they are not beyond the reach of death. While some Chosen live longer than their kin, or endure hardships that would break an ordinary mortal, none are truly invincible.

The Ascendants, for all their power, cannot shape the world directly—it is through The Chosen that they act, extending their influence beyond the divine boundaries placed upon them. To fully sever The Chosen from mortality would contradict their very purpose, making them something else entirely—no longer a bridge between the divine and the mortal, but something apart from both.

That is not to say The Chosen do not possess resilience beyond that of ordinary mortals. Many are sustained by their Boons, allowing them to endure where others would fall. Some heal quickly, their wounds closing faster than expected; others resist exhaustion, affliction, or even the slow decay of age. But no Boon is infinite, and no Chosen is beyond harm.

For many, their greatest struggle is not one of survival, but of purpose. A warrior may fall in battle long before age ever threatens them. A scholar may outlive their students, their knowledge stretching beyond the reach of their generation. A ruler may bear the weight of leadership until it crushes them under expectation. Some disappear into history, their deaths unknown, their names whispered only in legend.

Yet even after their mortal end, The Chosen are never truly forgotten. Their legacies live on, shaping the world as much in death as they did in life. And for those who endure far longer than they should, the price of time itself may become their greatest burden.

### **Fading Humanity**

The Chosen may wield divine power, but they are still mortal. Their hearts beat, their bodies age, and their souls remain bound to the same cycle of life and death as any other. However, for those who live long enough, the touch of the divine leaves its mark in ways beyond their gifts.

While most Chosen live and die within a mortal span, some—whether through their own unnaturally long lifespans, the nature of their Boons, or by the will of their patron Ascendant—endure far beyond what should be possible. These individuals may persist for centuries, their bodies sustained by the divine spark within them. Yet time does not pass them by unnoticed.

The longer a Chosen walks the world, the more they begin to drift from the mortal concerns they once held. Their thoughts stretch across decades rather than days, their emotions grow tempered by long centuries of experience, and their perspective shifts toward something more akin to their patron’s vision than that of humanity. Some become detached and contemplative, watching over civilization as silent observers, while others grow weary of the endless years, fading into obscurity, their names becoming legend even while they yet live.

This transformation does not happen quickly—only those who persist for centuries ever reach such a state. Many long-lived Chosen struggle against it, holding fast to their mortal ties through their relationships, their beliefs, or their memories. Some seek solitude, no longer feeling truly at home among the fleeting lives of mortals. Others, though rare, embrace their distance, shaping events with a patience no human ruler could match.

However, no matter how long a Chosen endures, they are not eternal. Eventually, even those who have lived for ages will fade—by choice, by battle, or by the will of their patron. In the end, they are never truly lost, for their deeds and their legacies persist long after they are gone.

### **Loss of Divine Favor**

The Chosen are granted divine power, but that power is not an unconditional gift. While an Ascendant does not strip a Chosen of their Boons lightly, their continued favor is not guaranteed.

For most, the bond between a Chosen and their patron remains strong throughout their lifetime. But if a Chosen’s path drifts too far from the ideals of their Ascendant, their power may wane. This does not happen suddenly, nor does it come without warning—Boons weaken, divine guidance fades, and the Chosen may feel a growing distance from the source of their strength.

There is no single way in which favor is lost. Some Chosen slowly turn away from their patron’s ideals, their own beliefs or experiences reshaping their worldview. Others may make a single, defining choice that severs them from the divine, acting in a way that their patron cannot condone. Some fight against this loss, seeking redemption; others embrace it, choosing to walk away from their divine role rather than remain bound to an ideology they no longer serve.

If a Chosen willingly steps down, the process is often peaceful. A quiet moment of prayer, a final act in line with their patron’s ideals, or simply a recognition that their path has ended may be all it takes for their Boons to fade. In these cases, the Ascendant may watch their departure with understanding, neither punishing nor rewarding their choice.

But those who turn against their Ascendant outright—not just straying from their path, but actively opposing their patron’s will—risk something far worse. Some Ascendants reclaim power swiftly, cutting their bond the moment betrayal is clear. Others enact divine retribution, ensuring that the Chosen’s fall is as much a lesson as it is a punishment. What form this takes varies—some are cursed, others broken, and some are erased from history altogether.

A Chosen may rise, fall, or fade, but their story is never without consequence. Whether remembered as a saint, a lost soul, or a warning, the loss of divine favor is as much a part of their legend as the moment they were first chosen.
