### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Healer is revered by those who seek to mend, protect, and preserve life in all its forms. Physicians and midwives whisper her name in moments of crisis, herbalists and alchemists study under her guidance, and clerics devoted to restoration carry her teachings into battlefields and city streets alike. While some healers serve only those in their immediate reach, others see their calling as a greater duty—to restore not just individuals, but communities, nations, and the very fabric of the world. Her temples are often hospitals, sanctuaries, or places of refuge where the weary and wounded find aid without question.

Most of her followers lean good, embracing both compassion and duty in their pursuit of healing. Lawful devotees see her as a patron of structure and medical advancement, organizing healing orders and structured hospitals. Chaotic followers believe healing is about direct action and change, moving from place to place and helping wherever they can. While she does not outright condone violence, some of her followers interpret her teachings as a call to action against those who cause harm, striking down those who spread suffering so that others may heal in peace.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Healer appears as a female Hill Dwarf, her presence exuding a warmth that is neither overwhelming nor blinding, but gentle, constant, and enduring—a light that never wavers even in the darkest times. Her soft, golden-copper skin glows faintly, as though kissed by an eternal sunrise, radiating quiet reassurance. Her auburn hair cascades in loose waves, framing a face marked not by age, but by experience and kindness, her features carrying the wisdom of countless lives touched by her care.

Her golden-bronze eyes are filled with compassion and quiet strength, piercing through surface wounds to the pain beneath—whether it is physical, emotional, or spiritual. She wears robes of deep forest green and cream, their embroidery woven with copper sprigs of healing herbs and delicate, blooming flowers, each detail shimmering faintly with life. Around her waist is a braided belt of living vines, adorned with glowing, dewdrop-like crystals that pulse softly with divine energy, as if breathing in harmony with the wounded she tends. Wherever she steps, the earth responds—plants bloom in her wake, wilted flowers regain color, and the air carries the comforting scent of fresh earth and lavender.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Healer manifests in times of great suffering and need, but never as a mere observer—when she arrives, it is to act. In her Aspect, she walks among the wounded with steady hands and unwavering focus, each touch mending torn flesh, soothing fevered minds, or rekindling the spark of life in those on the brink of death. She does not declare her presence, nor does she demand recognition—her arrival is marked only by the quiet hum of renewal, the air thick with the scent of herbs and the warmth of unseen sunlight breaking through storm-choked skies.

When she does not appear in full form, she manifests through small, undeniable signs—the sudden cessation of bleeding in a dying warrior, a fevered child finding cool relief in an unseen touch, a healer’s trembling hands steadying in their moment of greatest need. Some claim to hear her voice in moments of crisis—not as a command, but as a steady reassurance, guiding their hands, their will, and their heart to do what must be done. In rare cases, a golden glow may settle over an afflicted area, speeding recovery, or flowers may bloom near the fallen, signifying that her gaze has turned upon them.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Healer is not a gentle, distant caretaker—she is a fierce protector, as relentless as she is compassionate. She does not see healing as an act of passive mercy but as a weapon against suffering, a means to ensure that the world does not break under the weight of pain and loss. Mortals are not fragile in her eyes—they are strong, but strength means nothing if it is abandoned when most needed. She does not simply mend wounds; she defends, shields, and fights to ensure those wounds are not inflicted in the first place.

Though she abhors suffering, she does not shy away from it. Where others hesitate, she acts—sometimes to heal, sometimes to chastise those who cause harm. She is not a pacifist, nor is she willing to let cruelty go unanswered. To her, a healer who does nothing but mend wounds without addressing the source of pain is no better than a bystander. She has little patience for those who exploit kindness, and while she believes in second chances, she is unwilling to waste her gifts on those who do not seek to change. Failure weighs heavily on her, and while she does not expect to save everyone, each life lost lingers in her thoughts, pushing her to do more.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Healer teaches that to heal is not merely to repair, but to fortify. True healing is not just tending wounds, but ensuring those wounds do not return. Compassion is a duty, not a weakness, and protection is as sacred as restoration. Those who follow her must be prepared to not only mend, but to stand against that which causes harm, for a healer who allows suffering to persist is complicit in its spread.

- **Tenets**
    1. Healing is not just about survival—it is about ensuring a life worth living.
    2. Kindness without action is empty. If you can protect, you must.
    3. Do not waste your gifts on those who only seek to harm again. Some wounds must be cauterized.
    4. Strength is not found in enduring suffering, but in overcoming it. Never mistake pain for growth.
    5. A healer’s hands should build a better future, not merely repair the past.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Healer’s strongest alliance is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]], for both embody the ideals of guidance, hope, and the preservation of life. While The Healer mends the wounds of the body and spirit, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]] offers enlightenment, ensuring that those who are saved have the wisdom to walk forward into a brighter future. Their bond is one of necessity—hope is meaningless without life to carry it, and life without purpose is a hollow existence. Equally, The Healer shares a deep connection with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], for civilization thrives only when its people are healthy and cared for. Where [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] builds, The Healer safeguards, ensuring that sickness, despair, and suffering do not erode the progress of mortals. Without The Healer, cities would crumble under the weight of plagues and misery; without [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], The Healer’s efforts would be wasted on a world unwilling to move forward.

Her devotion to the well-being of others also aligns her with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], who understands that a ruler’s duty extends beyond war and law—without the health and strength of their people, no kingdom can endure. The Healer ensures that stability is maintained not just through governance, but through the well-being of the citizens who sustain a nation. Likewise, though she does not always agree with his carefree nature, The Healer finds an unlikely yet vital connection with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]]. While she sees the dangers of indulgence, she also acknowledges that joy, celebration, and laughter are as crucial to healing as medicine and magic. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] reminds her that life is not only about survival, but about truly living, and she values the way he lifts the spirits of the weary. Though she often finds herself sighing at his recklessness, she cannot deny that his influence brings comfort and relief to those weighed down by hardship.

#### Conflicts

A frequent point of contention exists between The Healer and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]]. While The Healer respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]]’s dedication to justice and law, she cannot abide by the rigid, black-and-white nature of her judgments. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], crime must be met with punishment, and justice must be absolute. But The Healer believes that people can change, that even the worst souls may find redemption if given the chance. She grows frustrated when [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] enforces unyielding verdicts, and in turn, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] sees The Healer’s mercy as weakness, believing that sparing the undeserving only allows injustice to fester. Another source of conflict lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], who values preparation and sacrifice over sentimentality. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] sees war and conflict as inevitabilities to be mastered, and to her, victory is paramount—casualties are merely the cost of securing a greater future. The Healer, however, despises the cold pragmatism of such thinking, believing that no victory is worth the unnecessary loss of life. She does not reject the necessity of war, but she refuses to accept that it must always come at the price of suffering. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], The Healer’s reluctance to acknowledge that some lives must be sacrificed for the greater good is naïve, while The Healer sees [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]]’s willingness to treat soldiers as numbers rather than people as deeply troubling.

Her greatest ideological struggle, however, is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]], whose willingness to compromise can often clash with her ideals of protecting the vulnerable. While [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] works tirelessly to maintain stability and prevent needless war, The Healer sees a troubling pattern in his actions—sometimes, peace is preserved at the cost of those who suffer in silence. She despises negotiations that leave the weak unprotected, that allow tyrants to keep power for the sake of a fragile truce. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]], in turn, grows frustrated with her refusal to see the bigger picture, believing that some sacrifices are necessary to maintain order. Yet despite their differences, they share a begrudging respect, for both ultimately seek to reduce suffering, even if their methods are at odds. Her deepest conflict, however, lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], whose very existence defies everything she believes in. Where she seeks to heal, he hoards; where she gives freely, he claims ownership; where she sees the necessity of generosity, he sees only wasted opportunity. The Healer cannot comprehend [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]]’s belief that resources, knowledge, and wealth should be gathered and controlled rather than shared with those in need. She loathes his tendency to preserve things for the sake of possession rather than for the benefit of the world, and he, in turn, finds her philosophy naïve. To him, charity is foolishness—resources must be protected, not squandered on those who cannot repay their debts. Their opposition is fundamental, a clashing of ideals so deep that no debate, no reasoning, can bridge the gap between them.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Plague of Ashen Veins

In the earliest days of recorded history, a plague swept across the land, turning blood to dust and flesh to brittle stone. No magic, no healer, no prayer could stop its spread, and entire cities fell to silence. When mortals lost hope, The Healer walked among them, not in divine radiance, but as a simple physician. She did not cure with miracles, but with knowledge—teaching those who would listen, guiding hands to the right herbs, and whispering forgotten remedies into the ears of desperate scholars. Though many perished, those who heeded her wisdom endured, passing down the secrets of medicine she had gifted them. When the plague finally faded, the knowledge remained, ensuring no such sickness would ever bring the world to its knees again. It is said that the last traces of the disease were sealed away in a hidden vault, not by any gods, but by healers, who knew that true salvation does not come from divinity alone, but from the wisdom shared among mortals.

#### Aelis, the Hand of Mercy

Aelis was once a warrior, trained to take lives rather than save them. Yet, after witnessing the horrors of war, she cast down her sword and swore an oath before The Healer: to never again take a life, only to mend what others sought to break. In answer, The Healer granted her a gift—hands that could not wield a weapon, but could knit wounds as if time itself had been reversed. Aelis became a legend, walking unarmed into battlefields, healing friend and foe alike. Armies laid down their weapons in her presence, for to strike her was to invite divine wrath. When she grew old, her hands frail with age, The Healer appeared before her once more—not to take back her gift, but to place a single vial of liquid silver in her palms. "For the day," she said, "when you must choose to break your oath." Aelis never used it, and when she died, the vial was sealed away. To this day, some say it still exists, waiting for the hands of another who might make the same vow.

#### The Parable of the Wounded Tyrant

A cruel tyrant, feared for his wrath and iron rule, was struck down by his own treacherous general and left to die in the wilderness. As he lay suffering, he called out for aid, but none dared to help him. Finally, an old healer found him and, without question, tended his wounds. "Why do you waste your skills on me?" the tyrant asked. "The world rejoices at my suffering." The healer only smiled. "Pain is not justice," she said. "It is merely pain." When he was well enough to stand, she left him to find his own way home. Humbled, the tyrant returned to his people, but he ruled no longer with fear. From that day on, he was known not for his cruelty, but for his wisdom, for he had learned that healing is not only of the body, but of the soul.
