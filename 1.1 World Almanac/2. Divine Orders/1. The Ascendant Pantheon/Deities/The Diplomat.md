### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Diplomat is revered by those who shape the world not through war, but through words. Ambassadors and politicians invoke his name before entering delicate negotiations, while merchants and traders seek his favor to ensure profitable deals. His influence extends beyond the obvious practitioners of diplomacy—spies, courtiers, and even con artists turn to him, believing that deception is merely another tool in the great game of influence. His temples are not grand houses of worship, but council chambers, embassies, and the private offices of those who move the world with persuasion rather than force.

While many of his followers lean neutral, interpreting his teachings as the mastery of rhetoric and compromise, he has adherents across the moral spectrum. Lawful diplomats see him as a patron of structure and order, ensuring that alliances hold and treaties endure. Chaotic worshipers embrace him as a master of manipulation, favoring cunning over rigid rules. Good-aligned devotees use his wisdom to unite warring factions and foster peace, while evil-aligned followers wield his gifts to gain power, ensuring their words dictate the fate of others. Regardless of their approach, all who seek influence—be it through truth or deception—acknowledge The Diplomat as the master of the spoken word.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Diplomat appears as a Human male of such breathtaking beauty and presence that he seems sculpted rather than born. His sunlit bronze skin shimmers faintly, as though perpetually kissed by dawn’s first light, each movement catching a radiance that feels just beyond mortal comprehension. His sharp, symmetrical features are unnervingly perfect, his face crafted with such precision that to look upon him is to feel both awe and unease, as if the very idea of imperfection has been erased.

His piercing silver eyes gleam like exquisitely polished metal beneath the noonday sun, drawing those who meet his gaze into a spellbinding sense of trust and admiration. His dark, wavy hair falls just above his shoulders, effortlessly styled yet never appearing deliberate, always maintaining an air of un-trying elegance. Draped over him is a flowing cloak of liquid silver, its shifting patterns catching and reflecting light in ways that make it impossible to look away. Around him lingers the faint scent of exotic spices, intoxicating yet familiar, as if tailored to evoke personal nostalgia in all who breathe it in. When he speaks, his voice is a symphony of tones—low, rich, and melodic, each word precisely crafted to cut through doubt and draw listeners ever deeper into his orbit.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Diplomat rarely manifests in his full divine form, preferring to influence the world through unseen whispers, fortuitous circumstances, and sudden flashes of rhetorical brilliance. His presence is often felt in the moments before a deal is struck, when tensions ease inexplicably, or when a speaker finds the perfect words without knowing why. His favor may manifest as ink flowing flawlessly from a quill, a silver coin landing on its edge in a fateful gamble, or a hidden opportunity revealing itself at precisely the right moment.

When he chooses to appear more directly, it is often in the form of an indistinct yet mesmerizing figure seen from the corner of one’s eye—a presence that lingers just long enough to plant an idea, soften a stance, or sow the seeds of persuasion. To those who seek his guidance in times of negotiation, his arrival is heralded by an unseen breeze stirring papers and silks, the distant sound of murmured conversation, or the subtle shifting of candlelight as though the air itself is leaning in to listen.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Diplomat sees mortals as both pawns and players in the grand game of influence, each capable of shaping the world through speech, persuasion, and carefully measured action. To him, true power does not lie in swords or armies, but in words, promises, and carefully woven alliances. He does not look down upon mortals as lesser beings, nor does he view them with particular sentimentality—rather, he sees them as endlessly fascinating, unpredictable in their ambitions and ever-shifting in their loyalties. Some prove themselves masters of the game, while others are unwittingly moved across the board by forces greater than themselves.

Above all, he values those who understand the weight of words—the leaders who can shape nations with a single speech, the merchants who turn a phrase into profit, and the cunning minds who weave deception so artfully that even the deceived feel fortunate. Those who refuse to engage in the dance of negotiation, who rely solely on brute force or blind conviction, earn his disinterest at best and his disdain at worst. To The Diplomat, civilization itself is a delicate construction of agreements and discourse, and those who fail to recognize that are little more than reckless destroyers of something far greater than themselves.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Diplomat teaches that words are the truest form of power, more enduring than any sword and more effective than any army. A well-placed promise can topple empires, a single sentence can ignite revolutions, and the right voice in the right ear can reshape the world without shedding a single drop of blood. He does not preach honesty, nor does he demand deceit—only that his followers recognize that influence is a weapon, and it must be wielded with skill.

- **Tenets**
    1. A careless tongue is as dangerous as a dull blade—choose your words with precision.
    2. Every deal, every promise, and every negotiation is a battlefield. Fight with wit, not with steel.
    3. Power is an illusion shaped by perception. Control the narrative, and you control the world.
    4. There is no shame in manipulation; only in failing to achieve your goals.
    5. Silence is an opportunity wasted. Speak, guide, persuade, and the world will bend to you.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Diplomat’s closest alliance is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], as both understand that knowledge and secrets shape the foundation of power. While [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] uncovers hidden truths, The Diplomat ensures they are wielded effectively, using information to broker peace or shift the tides of influence. They work in tandem—one revealing what lies in the shadows, the other ensuring that such knowledge is used to stabilize rather than destroy. Likewise, The Diplomat finds a steadfast partner in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], for rulership is not built on authority alone, but on the careful weaving of alliances. The Diplomat ensures that [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]]’s oaths are upheld in ways that benefit his rule, offering compromise where rigidity might lead to ruin. In turn, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] provides the authority that The Diplomat requires, recognizing that governance demands more than just force—it requires negotiation, balance, and the careful maintenance of order.

Equally vital is The Diplomat’s connection to [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]], with whom he shares a mutual understanding of prosperity through cooperation. Trade and diplomacy are inseparable; deals struck at the negotiation table determine the fates of cities as surely as those made in the marketplace. However, they also acknowledge the subtle tension between them—where [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] thrives on movement and risk, The Diplomat relies on stability and careful planning. Yet, despite this contrast, they find common ground in ensuring that wealth flows and that agreements hold value beyond mere coin. Similarly, The Diplomat has a productive, if uneasy, alliance with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]]. Influence and wealth often go hand in hand, and while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]]’s hoarding nature clashes with The Diplomat’s desire for circulation and exchange, they both understand the importance of control. The Diplomat ensures wealth remains in motion to maintain political balance, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] safeguards assets to secure long-term stability.

#### Conflicts

Among his most troubling relationships is the one with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], for while both deal in matters of foresight and preparation, The Diplomat sees the weight of prophecy as a dangerous rigidity. He believes that the future should be shaped by careful negotiation and strategic maneuvering, not bound to a fate preordained. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], in turn, finds his attempts to circumvent destiny both futile and misguided, regarding his compromises as short-term solutions that fail to grasp the broader picture of fate. Their tension is one of control—The Diplomat believes the world is shaped by those who act, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] sees it as a grand design that no amount of persuasion can alter. Another source of frustration is [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], whose chaotic nature disrupts the careful balance The Diplomat works to maintain. While [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] sees joy and spontaneity as essential, The Diplomat sees them as forces that, if left unchecked, lead to instability and recklessness. While he does not seek to stifle revelry, he grows exasperated by [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]]’s refusal to recognize the consequences of his actions, viewing his influence as a distraction from the careful work of diplomacy.

More directly opposed to The Diplomat is [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], with whom he frequently clashes on matters of principle. Where The Diplomat values negotiation and adaptability, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] believes in law as an unyielding force. To The Diplomat, laws must be flexible to meet the needs of the world, evolving as circumstances change, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] holds that justice must remain absolute, unshaken by the whims of mortals. Their conflict is not one of open hostility, but of fundamental philosophy—where The Diplomat sees the strength of compromise, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] sees weakness in bending principles to suit convenience. Yet, his greatest opposition is to [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], for where The Diplomat sees words as the most powerful weapon, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] believes it is steel, discipline, and preparation that determine the course of history. To The Diplomat, a skilled negotiator can shape nations without ever raising a blade, bending the world with carefully chosen words. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], however, scoffs at such ideals, believing that diplomacy without force to back it is merely wishful thinking. The Diplomat views war as a failure of governance, a sign that negotiations were not properly handled, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] sees war as an inevitability—an extension of governance, rather than a breakdown of it. Their conflict is one of approach: The Diplomat believes a skilled tongue can prevent bloodshed, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] argues that, in the end, it is the sword that dictates the terms.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Accord of Seven Banners

In the age before nations, when warlords ruled and peace was a fleeting dream, seven great leaders met upon a blood-soaked battlefield, each prepared to fight to the last. It was then that The Diplomat stepped forward—not as a warrior, but as a voice of reason. He spoke not of surrender, but of prosperity, painting a future where their strength could build rather than destroy. Though they distrusted his words, they listened, and in the end, they swore an oath upon a stone tablet, carving their marks into its unyielding surface. For generations, their lands flourished, but when a descendant sought to break the treaty, believing himself above the words of his ancestors, the mark of his lineage burned upon his skin, searing his flesh as he fell dead upon the throne he had seized. The stone was lost to time, but legend holds that any who swear upon it are bound—not by magic, but by the weight of their own word.

#### Varos the Silver Tongue

Varos was not a warrior, nor a king, nor even a noble. He was a simple courtier with an uncanny ability to turn enemies into allies, to weave words so fine they became more binding than any oath. When he was young, The Diplomat took notice of him—not for what he was, but for what he could become. Under his silent guidance, Varos rose through the courts of kings, never ruling, but always holding power through whispered words and well-placed agreements. Wars were ended, feuds resolved, and alliances forged where none had seemed possible. In time, his reputation grew beyond the limits of a single kingdom, and rulers from across the land sought his counsel. It is said that on the day he died, a hundred monarchs mourned him, for he had shaped their realms more than any blade or crown ever could. Some believe that even in death, his voice lingers in the halls of power, guiding those who seek peace but do not know the words to ask for it.

#### The Parable of the Deaf King

A king once ruled with an iron hand, believing that strength alone could shape the world. He ignored the counsel of his advisors, dismissed the warnings of his diplomats, and scoffed at the treaties placed before him. "Words do not build empires," he declared. "Steel does." And so he waged war, conquering lands, shattering alliances, and forging a kingdom that stretched farther than any before. Yet, as time passed, his enemies grew more numerous, his borders more unstable, and his victories more costly. His people suffered, his allies dwindled, and when his last battle came, he found himself alone. As he lay dying upon the battlefield, he heard a whisper—The Diplomat’s voice, soft and knowing. "Words do not build empires," the voice echoed. "But they are what keep them standing." [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] died with steel in his hand, but no kingdom left to rule.
