# **The Reveler (Festivals, Indulgence, Luck)**

## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Hyena
- **Icon**: Lyre
- **Material**: Brass
- **Moral Alignment**: Chaotic Good
- **Common Worshipers**: Bards, gamblers, festival-goers, hedonists, free spirits, tricksters, and those who place their faith in luck and spontaneity

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Reveler is worshiped by those who embrace life in all its unpredictability, its highs and lows, its risks and rewards. Bards and performers invoke his name before stepping onto a stage, trusting in his favor to turn a crowd into an audience. Gamblers whisper prayers over their dice and cards, hoping for fortune’s touch. Tavern-goers and festival organizers dedicate their merrymaking to him, believing that every great revel is a sacred act in his eyes. He is not a god of structure or devotion, but of fleeting moments, of laughter shared between strangers, and of bold choices that define lives.

Most of his followers lean chaotic good, believing that joy, freedom, and chance are forces that must be embraced. Chaotic neutral worshipers see him as a patron of personal indulgence, living by the belief that luck rewards those who take what they want from life. Even some chaotic evil tricksters and thieves invoke his name before their misdeeds, mistaking his love of risk for an endorsement of reckless selfishness. Yet, those who act only for their own gain misunderstand him—for the Reveler does not bless greed or cruelty, only those who bring joy, those who dare, and those who trust in fate’s ever-turning wheel.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Reveler takes the form of a satyr, his lithe frame overflowing with boundless energy, a figure of unrestrained joy and indulgence. His golden-brown skin glimmers faintly, like the flickering light of a bonfire at the height of celebration. His chestnut hair curls wildly, crowned with small, polished horns of gilded ivory, their smooth surface catching the light as he moves. His mismatched eyes—one a rich amber, the other a vibrant green—sparkle with mirth and mischief, forever carrying the glint of an unspoken jest or a wager yet to be won.

He wears a flamboyant ensemble of crimson and gold, embroidered with intricate designs of dancing figures, leaping flames, and interwoven ribbons, each one shifting as if alive with the revel. Ribbons and jewels adorn his clothing, swaying and chiming softly with his every step, an ever-present accompaniment to his movements. In one hand, he holds a golden goblet, which overflows endlessly with sparkling wine, though it never spills unless he wills it. In the other, he carries a glowing lyre, its strings strumming themselves in perfect harmony with his laughter. When his joy reaches its peak, spectral hyenas caper and howl in playful abandon, their golden forms flickering in and out of existence, their laughter blending seamlessly with his own.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Reveler does not appear with divine authority or grand pronouncements—he arrives when the night is alive with laughter, when the stakes of a game are at their highest, or when a celebration teeters on the edge of greatness. His presence is felt in the heightened energy of a festival, the rush of exhilaration before a daring risk, or the wild abandon of a dance that lasts until dawn. Those who find themselves at the center of revelry may catch a fleeting glimpse of golden-brown skin weaving through the crowd, a flash of mismatched eyes watching from the firelight, or the sound of an unseen lyre keeping perfect time with their revels.

Unlike many Ascendants, The Reveler appears frequently, though never predictably. He manifests most often at grand celebrations—festivals, victory feasts, raucous tavern gatherings, and wagers of great consequence. His presence is never subtle—he arrives dancing, laughing, and alive with motion, his steps leaving behind trails of wildflowers bursting into bloom, the air around him filling with the intoxicating scent of mead, spices, and festival smoke. The distant echoes of raucous cheers and revelry linger faintly in the background, as if the celebration of all mortal joy carries with him wherever he goes. Those who meet his gaze feel a pull—not of compulsion, but of invitation—to join the dance, to roll the dice, to embrace the moment before it slips away.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Reveler sees mortals as beings meant to live, not merely to exist. To him, life is a fleeting dance of chance, a grand revel where fate itself plays the music. He delights in their ability to seize the moment, to take risks, to embrace the unknown with laughter rather than fear. He does not concern himself with laws, traditions, or rigid doctrines—life is too short for hesitation and regret, and fortune favors those who throw themselves into its embrace.

However, he is not blind to suffering. He understands that hardship is an inevitable part of mortal existence, but he does not see sorrow as something to be endured—it is something to be burned away in the fires of revelry. Luck, he teaches, does not come to those who wait—it comes to those who take the leap, roll the dice, and trust in the chaos of the world to carry them forward. To the lost, he offers belonging; to the weary, he offers reprieve; to the brokenhearted, he offers release. To the Reveler, a world without celebration, risk, and indulgence is a world already dead.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Reveler teaches that life’s pleasures are not distractions, but necessities. Celebration is not meaningless—it is a sacred release, a reminder that existence is more than toil and struggle. He urges his followers to seek joy, embrace revelry, trust in fortune, and uplift those who have forgotten how to live.

- **Tenets**
    1. Joy is not a luxury—it is essential. Life is meant to be celebrated, and those who revel are favored by fate.
    2. Indulgence is not weakness. Feast, dance, drink, and love as though tomorrow may never come—fortune smiles upon those who embrace the moment.
    3. Luck is found in risk, not in waiting. Take the chance, throw the dice, and trust that the world will catch you.
    4. Bring others into the revel. No one should be alone in their joy or their sorrow, for luck and laughter are meant to be shared.
    5. The greatest sin is to waste the time you have. Live boldly, live freely, and leave behind a story worth telling.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Reveler and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] share a thriving and mutually beneficial relationship, as prosperity and indulgence often go hand in hand. Festivals, taverns, and celebrations drive trade, creating a constant demand for luxuries, fine food, drink, and entertainment. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] appreciates the wealth generated by revelry, while The Reveler enjoys the endless flow of goods that fuel indulgence. Their bond is built on the simple truth that joy and prosperity are deeply intertwined—one cannot exist without the other. Similarly, The Reveler finds a close connection with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]], for both understand that life is not just about survival, but about truly living. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] mends wounds and cures diseases, but The Reveler ensures that people do not lose themselves in suffering. Laughter, pleasure, and companionship are forms of healing, and though [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] may sometimes find his excesses irresponsible, she acknowledges that a world without joy is a world not worth saving.

The Reveler also shares an unexpected alliance with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], for civilization is not just built on work and ambition, but also on culture, celebration, and shared joy. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] ensures the survival and advancement of society, while The Reveler gives it meaning, preserving traditions and festivities that bring people together. He ensures that cities are not just places of labor and governance, but places where mortals can revel in their existence, forging bonds of camaraderie through song, dance, and indulgence. Likewise, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] and The Reveler, though different in their pursuits, share a deep love of experience and discovery. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] chases knowledge, unraveling mysteries and uncovering lost truths, while The Reveler chases sensation, living life through excitement and new experiences. They both reject stagnation, believing that nothing—whether knowledge or pleasure—should remain hidden forever.

#### Conflicts

Of all the Ascendants, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] is The Reveler’s most natural opposition, for law and revelry rarely coexist. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] values restraint, discipline, and the enforcement of order, while The Reveler thrives in spontaneity, indulgence, and the rejection of restriction. Where she sees him as an agent of chaos, disrupting structure and stability, he sees her as a force of lifeless rigidity, imposing meaningless rules that rob mortals of the joys they deserve. He mocks her devotion to rules, believing that a world dictated entirely by laws is a world drained of its spirit. Another point of conflict lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], whose belief in structure and rulership stands in direct opposition to The Reveler’s love of freedom and excess. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], The Reveler is a disruptive force, a distraction that weakens the discipline of leaders and citizens alike. The Reveler, in turn, believes that [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]]’s obsession with control stifles true joy, turning life into a series of duties rather than a celebration of existence.

The Reveler also finds himself at odds with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]], for where one pursues knowledge through deep thought and careful study, the other embraces experience over contemplation. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] values discipline, patience, and careful understanding, while The Reveler believes that knowledge is best gained through living, tasting, and feeling the world firsthand. To The Reveler, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] wastes time locked away in books instead of embracing the thrill of discovery through experience. Meanwhile, his most frequent clashes occur with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], whose structured, disciplined approach to life is everything The Reveler rejects. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] sees revelry as a dangerous distraction, a force that leads to complacency and weakens the mind and body. The Reveler, in turn, ridicules her rigid planning and endless calculations, believing that the best moments in life come from unplanned chaos. Their conflict is not just one of philosophy, but of temperament—one finds beauty in structure, the other in disorder, ensuring that they will never truly see eye to eye.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Festival That Lasted a Year

There was once a kingdom on the brink of collapse, its people weary from endless war, its rulers too burdened to see beyond their suffering. Crops withered, streets emptied, and laughter became a thing of the past. It is said that one night, a stranger arrived in the city square, playing on his lyre a tune that had not been heard in generations. The melody was light, his step carefree, and though no one knew his name, they felt the weight upon their shoulders lessen as he played. When he poured a goblet of wine, its taste was richer than any before, and when he called for a dance, feet that had forgotten joy moved without hesitation. For one night, the people let go of their sorrows. And then another. And another. A festival that was meant to last a single evening stretched into a week, then a month, then a full year. The war was thus won easily, the fields flourished once more, and when at last the stranger was gone, his mark remained—not in gold or monuments, but in the spirit of a people who had learned that joy is not an indulgence, but a necessity.

#### Cassia, the Gambler of Fate

Cassia was born with the world against her—poor, alone, and with nothing but wit and charm to carry her forward. She lived by dice rolls and card games, by chance encounters and well-placed bets, but what others saw as recklessness, she called faith. One evening, The Reveler appeared before her, offering her a single wager: a game of chance against him, where the prize was anything she desired. Knowing she could not outplay an Ascendant, she made her wager not on a roll of the dice, but on her own ambition. "I wager," she said, "that I will walk away from this table richer than I was before—whether I win or lose." The Reveler threw back his head and laughed, for she had already learned the lesson he wished to teach. He granted her not a fortune, but something greater—the certainty that life itself is a gamble, and only those who dare to play ever have a chance at winning. From that night on, every game Cassia played seemed to turn in her favor, not because of magic, but because she had learned that luck is not given—it is seized.

#### The Parable of the Bottled Heart

There was once a man who believed that joy was a distraction, that laughter was frivolous, and that only discipline and practicality could lead to success. So he bottled up every moment of happiness he felt—every smile, every laugh, every fleeting warmth of companionship—sealing them away so they would not weaken his resolve. He built a life of structure and control, rising to great power and earning the respect of many. Yet, as the years passed, he found himself weary, his victories hollow, his achievements met with silence. One night, The Reveler appeared before him, holding the bottles of joy he had cast aside. "*Shall I open them for you?*" he asked with a knowing grin. But the man only shook his head—he no longer knew how to feel what had been locked away. With a shrug, The Reveler smashed the bottles upon the ground, and the laughter inside spilled out—but it no longer belonged to the man. It drifted away, finding new hearts to fill, while he was left with only the echoes of the joy he had denied himself, never to feel happiness again.
