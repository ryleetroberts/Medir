# **The Seeker (Secrets, Curiosity, Shadows)**

## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Lynx
- **Icon**: Key
- **Material**: Obsidian
- **Moral Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Common Worshipers**: Investigators, spies, cryptographers, seekers of lost knowledge, shadowy informants, archaeologists, and those who thrive in secrecy

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Seeker is worshiped by those who value knowledge not just for its power, but for the thrill of discovery itself. His followers are the watchers in the dark, the quiet observers, the ones who ask the questions no one else dares to voice. Investigators invoke his name when unraveling a conspiracy, cryptographers pray for clarity when deciphering ancient texts, and spies mark their messages with his sigil before passing them into unseen hands. To them, he is not simply a god of hidden things—he is the one who reveals, who guides, who pushes them toward the truths others would rather leave forgotten.

Most of his worshipers lean neutral, understanding that secrets are not inherently good or evil—it is how they are used that defines their worth. Lawful seekers serve as guardians of lost knowledge, ensuring that history is preserved and that dangerous truths do not fall into the wrong hands. Chaotic followers see secrecy as a game, believing that nothing should be hidden, that everything must be exposed to the world. Some evil-aligned worshipers seek to twist his teachings, believing that shadows exist to be manipulated and that knowledge should serve only those cunning enough to claim it—but they often fail to understand his deeper lesson. To follow The Seeker is not to claim knowledge for oneself—it is to understand when to uncover, when to conceal, and when to let the unknown remain as it is.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Seeker appears as a tall, shadow-cloaked figure, their form concealed beneath an ever-shifting veil of darkness that breathes and writhes like living mist. The veil obscures all but fleeting glimpses—the slender frame of a Drow male, the glint of silver eyes peering through the gloom, the faint trace of a knowing smirk before it vanishes into the shifting black. His movements are silent, weightless, as if he is never truly standing in one place, but rather existing between spaces, slipping in and out of sight before the mind can fully register him.

His attire is woven from shadow and starlit fabric, its patterns shifting subtly as if mirroring the unseen paths of fate and the concealed truths of the world. Around his wrists and ankles, delicate silver chains hang freely, unattached, drifting in the air as though tethered to unseen burdens—or perhaps, to secrets waiting to be unbound. A silver key dangles from a thin cord around his neck, glowing faintly and shifting in shape whenever it is observed too closely, as if it is always unlocking something just beyond perception.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Seeker rarely manifests fully, preferring instead to let his presence be felt through signs, whispers, and unseen guidance. His arrival is marked by the sudden absence of sound, the way shadows lengthen unnaturally, or the moment when a locked door seems to open just a little too easily. Those who walk in the dark might feel eyes upon them where none should be, or notice footsteps echoing their own just a half-second out of rhythm.

When he does appear, it is never directly, never fully—he is glimpsed from the corner of the eye, a silhouette vanishing through a doorway that was never opened, a whisper on the wind carrying the answer to a question unspoken, a lynx's tail disappearing around a corner. His voice is a layered whisper, as though many versions of himself speak at once, each word slightly out of sync with the next. And for those whom he truly favors, the world itself shifts—books fall open to hidden passages, unseen doors reveal themselves, and forgotten truths stir within the mind, remembered as if they had always been known.

## Personality & Philosophy

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Seeker views mortals as creatures defined by their hunger for the unknown—some drawn to uncovering it, others desperate to keep it hidden. To him, they are curious and fearful in equal measure, forever walking the line between revelation and ignorance. He does not interfere in their affairs, but he watches, ever fascinated by the choices they make—who seeks, who hides, and who dares to step into the unknown despite the risks.

He is neither a protector nor an adversary of secrets; he is simply their guardian and their liberator. Some knowledge is meant to be uncovered, while some is best left in shadow—the challenge lies in knowing which is which. To those who seek his favor, he offers guidance in riddles and whispers, rewarding those who show true curiosity and the patience to follow the right paths. But those who pry without purpose, who chase truths with no understanding of their weight, may find themselves consumed by the very shadows they sought to escape.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Seeker teaches that secrets are not inherently good or evil—they are merely truths not yet revealed. Curiosity is the key to understanding, but knowledge must be pursued with purpose, patience, and the willingness to accept its cost. Shadows are not meant to be feared, for within them lies both danger and wisdom.

- **Tenets**
    1. A question unasked is a truth lost—seek always, but seek wisely.
    2. Some secrets are meant to be uncovered. Others are meant to remain in shadow. Know the difference.
    3. Curiosity is the path to revelation, but only for those willing to see it through.
    4. Knowledge hidden out of fear is the most dangerous of all.
    5. The shadows do not lie; they merely conceal. Look deeper, and you will see.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Seeker’s closest and most complicated relationship is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], forming a paradoxical game of pursuit and preservation. The Seeker unearths hidden knowledge, lost artifacts, and forgotten truths, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] safeguards them, believing that some things are too valuable—or too dangerous—to be freely distributed. They pretend to be adversaries, with The Seeker constantly retrieving what [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] locks away, but without each other, neither would have purpose. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] thrives on possessing what is rare, and The Seeker exists to find what has been taken from the world. Though their clashes are frequent and their methods diametrically opposed, there is a mutual understanding between them, a begrudging respect that keeps them bound in their endless cycle of discovery and concealment. Similarly, The Seeker holds [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] in high regard, for while he uncovers what has been buried, she unveils what is yet to come. Though their approaches differ—one searching through action, the other simply knowing—they both deal in the unraveling of truth. The Seeker values [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]]’s visions as another form of knowledge, though he often finds her cryptic nature frustrating, preferring answers that are earned rather than simply granted.

The Seeker also shares an understanding with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]], for while The Seeker retrieves lost knowledge, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] refines and preserves it, ensuring that it is not lost again. Though [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] may find The Seeker reckless in his pursuit of the unknown, he cannot deny that The Seeker’s work is invaluable, recovering pieces of history that would otherwise fade from existence. Their methods may be different, but their purpose aligns. His final and most reluctant alliance is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]], who values information not for its intrinsic worth, but for its ability to shape outcomes. The Seeker respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]]’s vast network and his ability to ensure that information falls into the right hands, but he remains wary of the way [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] manipulates truth. While The Seeker seeks knowledge for its own sake, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] uses it as leverage, ensuring that secrets serve those who know how to wield them. Though he does not always approve of this, he acknowledges the incredible usefulness of [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]]’s domain, knowing that the right words in the right ears can be as powerful as the most well-kept secret.

#### Conflicts

One of The Seeker’s greatest adversaries is [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], for rulers thrive on stability, while The Seeker thrives on disruption. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] believes that some truths are best left undiscovered, that exposing secrets carelessly can unravel the very fabric of order. The Seeker, however, rejects the notion that any knowledge should be suppressed, believing that truth belongs to all who seek it. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] sees The Seeker as a force of uncertainty, while The Seeker views [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] as a gatekeeper of power, clinging to authority by keeping knowledge hidden from those who need it most. Similarly, he often finds himself at odds with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]], whose belief in divine truth contrasts with his pursuit of raw, unfiltered reality. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]]’s teachings are meant to guide mortals toward enlightenment, but The Seeker distrusts wisdom that is given rather than earned. To him, faith is a poor substitute for discovery, and he views [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]]’s insistence on guiding mortals as a limitation rather than a blessing. In return, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]] sees The Seeker’s relentless pursuit of secrets as reckless, believing that not all knowledge is meant to be revealed.

Perhaps his most direct opposition is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], whose rigid adherence to law and structure is the very thing The Seeker constantly undermines. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], justice is a matter of clear rules and established precedent, while The Seeker knows that truth is rarely so simple. He sees laws as constructs that often obscure more than they reveal, and he refuses to let authority dictate what is worth knowing. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], in turn, views The Seeker’s methods as dangerous, for some truths, when revealed without restraint, have the power to destroy order rather than uphold it. However, his most bitter rivalry is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]], for while both believe in the power of creation, they completely disagree on how past works should be handled. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] believes that craftsmanship and innovation should be utilized, that great works should be shared and improved upon, while The Seeker often uncovers lost masterpieces only to see them hoarded or locked away once more. He despises the hiding of great works, considering it an insult to those who created them, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] sees The Seeker’s recklessness as a wasteful disregard for the legacy of craftsmanship. Their conflict is one of utilization versus secrecy, of whether knowledge should be wielded freely or safeguarded from those who may misuse it.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Doors That Never Opened

Long ago, a great city stood at the crossroads of the world, its wealth unmatched, its secrets guarded by towering gates that had never been breached. Rulers came and went, each more paranoid than the last, sealing away their treasures, hoarding knowledge, and locking away even the wisest of scholars for fear that what they knew might be used against them. It is said that one night, The Seeker passed through the city unseen, though no lock had been broken and no gate had been forced. By morning, the vaults were empty—not of gold, but of secrets. The scrolls lay blank, the records turned to dust, the knowledge within them lost to the wind. When the people cried out in despair, The Seeker’s voice drifted from the shadows: "*A truth locked away is already lost.*" Without their hidden knowledge, the city crumbled into irrelevance, and the world moved on without it.

#### Selene, the Unbound Whisper

Selene was a child born beneath a moonless sky, a shadow among shadows, with an instinct for uncovering what others sought to conceal. No secret remained hidden from her for long, and no deception could withstand her quiet scrutiny. It is said that The Seeker found her when she was still young, watching as she unraveled riddles and traced whispers back to their sources. He did not teach her, nor did he guide her—he simply posed a single question: "*If you could know everything, would you want to?*" She spent a lifetime answering, following lost paths, deciphering forgotten texts, and seeking the knowledge that even the Ascendants had buried. In the end, she vanished as suddenly as she had arrived in the world, leaving behind no body, no grave—only a plain, unassuming dagger inscribed with a single phrase: "Some questions must never be answered."

#### The Parable of the Hidden Name

A scholar once sought the true name of The Seeker, believing that if he could call the Ascendant by name, he would be granted all the knowledge in existence. He scoured ruins, decrypted ancient texts, and followed rumors to the edges of the world. After decades of searching, he finally found the name inscribed upon a forgotten temple’s wall. Yet, when he spoke it aloud, he felt no revelation—only silence. Confused, he searched again, only to find that the name had changed, as if rewritten by an unseen hand. He spent the rest of his life chasing a truth that refused to be caught, never realizing that The Seeker’s greatest lesson was already before him: a name known by all is more secret than a name known by none.
