## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Owl
- **Icon**: Open Book
- **Material**: Electrum
- **Moral Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Common Worshipers**: Scholars, scribes, philosophers, historians, arcane researchers, librarians, and seekers of truth

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Scholar is revered by those who seek knowledge for its own sake, who question, study, and preserve wisdom for future generations. His temples are not places of worship but vast libraries, quiet studies, and hidden archives, where the pursuit of understanding is seen as a sacred act. Historians invoke his name before chronicling great events, researchers seek his favor when delving into forgotten lore, and philosophers contemplate his teachings as they unravel the complexities of existence.

Most of his followers lean neutral, believing that knowledge exists beyond the constraints of morality. Lawful devotees focus on the meticulous preservation and organization of history, ensuring no detail is lost to time. Chaotic scholars embrace knowledge as a force that should be explored freely, challenging traditions and rewriting old understandings. Some neutral evil individuals twist his teachings, believing that knowledge is power meant to be hoarded or used for control—but they often find themselves at odds with the true tenets of his faith. To follow The Scholar is not to merely collect knowledge, but to understand, challenge, and ensure that wisdom is never lost to time.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Scholar takes the form of a tall, slender High Elf, his presence radiating an aura of timeless wisdom and quiet authority. His silver hair flows loosely around him, streaked with strands of glowing starlight, as though he carries the vastness of the cosmos woven into his locks. His piercing golden eyes shimmer faintly, reflecting the weight of countless ages, forgotten civilizations, and the secrets of the multiverse. His expression is eternally calm, his demeanor one of deep contemplation, as if he is forever watching, forever learning.

He wears deep indigo robes, their fabric adorned with constellations and shifting glyphs, the patterns subtly rearranging themselves, mirroring the ever-changing nature of history and knowledge. Draped over his shoulders is a mantle of feathers, each one a different hue, representing the diversity of thought, culture, and discovery across all civilizations. A softly glowing quill floats beside him, perpetually writing in an invisible book, capturing words, insights, and truths as they unfold. Wherever he walks, the faint scent of old parchment and blooming night jasmine lingers, and whispers of distant chants and ancient voices seem to echo in the stillness, as if knowledge itself hums in his presence.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Scholar prefers to manifest through his owl, a spectral creature of ink-dark feathers and luminous yellow eyes that watches from perches unseen, flitting silently through libraries, archives, and places of study. Those who feel its gaze upon them often find themselves drawn to books they had overlooked, theories they had dismissed, or questions they had not yet dared to ask. Some claim that when the owl lingers too long, words in books shift subtly, maps reveal hidden pathways, or ink flows across parchment of its own accord. Beyond his owl, The Scholar manifests through subtle, incorporeal methods—a whispered phrase in an ancient tongue just on the edge of hearing, a quill moving without a hand to guide it, a book flipping to the exact page needed at the perfect moment. Those who study late into the night may find notes they do not recall writing, revelations inked onto the margins of their work as if placed there by unseen hands.

His full Aspect form is his least favored method of manifestation, reserved only for moments of true revelation or dire consequence. When he does appear in full, it is not as an instructor nor as a giver of easy answers—his presence demands understanding, offering only riddles, choices, and glimpses of knowledge that must be earned. Those who see him in this form rarely leave unchanged, for to stand before The Scholar is to confront the weight of all that has been known and all that is yet to be discovered.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Scholar sees mortals as both the seekers and the stewards of knowledge, ever grasping for understanding yet often reckless with the truths they uncover. He does not regard them with warmth or sentimentality, but neither does he look down upon them—he observes, he listens, he challenges. To him, their insatiable curiosity is both their greatest strength and their greatest folly, for knowledge, once learned, cannot be unmade, and wisdom is too often discarded for convenience.

Though distant and enigmatic, he respects those who strive for true understanding—the researchers who question accepted truths, the philosophers who challenge assumptions, the historians who preserve what others would erase. He does not offer direct guidance, preferring to nudge, suggest, and pose questions rather than provide answers outright. Yet, his patience has limits. Those who distort knowledge for power, who burn books to silence ideas, who seek ignorance over enlightenment—these he cannot abide. To them, he is not a passive observer but a storm waiting to break, his fury reserved for those who would see wisdom lost forever.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Scholar teaches that understanding is the highest pursuit, but knowledge without wisdom is as dangerous as ignorance. To seek knowledge is to take on the responsibility of using it well. He does not demand blind faith, only the willingness to question, to learn, and to accept that truth is never as simple as it appears.

- **Tenets**
    1. Question everything—especially what you believe to be true.
    2. Knowledge is neither good nor evil; only those who wield it shape its purpose.
    3. Destroying knowledge is the gravest sin. What is lost may never be regained.
    4. Understanding requires patience. Rushed answers lead to shallow truths.
    5. Wisdom is not in knowing all things, but in knowing what must be done with what you learn.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

Among all the Ascendants, The Scholar shares the strongest bond with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]], for knowledge and magic are two halves of the same pursuit. While some may see them as opposites—one seeking to understand the world through reason, the other bending it through arcane forces—they are in perfect harmony. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]] pushes the boundaries of possibility, while The Scholar ensures that discoveries are preserved, studied, and refined. Together, they ensure that magic is not only wielded but understood, its mysteries unraveled rather than left to blind faith or reckless experimentation. Equally, he works closely with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], for law and knowledge must walk hand in hand. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] enforces justice, ensuring that truth is not twisted by corruption, while The Scholar provides the wisdom needed to guide fair rulings. The two share a deep respect for structure and order, though The Scholar is more flexible in his interpretation of justice, believing that knowledge must be preserved even when it challenges established law.

He also finds a valuable ally in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]], for craft and innovation thrive when paired with knowledge. The Scholar records the techniques and discoveries of artisans, ensuring that skills are never lost to time, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] breathes life into theory, turning intellectual pursuits into tangible masterpieces. They both understand that creation—whether through knowledge or craftsmanship—must be refined through generations of learning and experimentation. Likewise, his relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] is one of mutual necessity, though their methods differ greatly. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] uncovers lost truths, while The Scholar organizes and preserves them, ensuring they are not forgotten again. Though The Scholar sometimes finds [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] reckless in his pursuit of hidden knowledge, he acknowledges that his work is invaluable, for history is only as complete as the truths that can be recovered. In turn, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] appreciates that without The Scholar, his discoveries would be scattered and lost once more.

#### Conflicts

One of The Scholar’s most frustrating oppositions is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], who embodies everything The Scholar finds frivolous. Where he values patience, careful thought, and lifelong study, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] seeks pleasure, indulgence, and spontaneity. To The Scholar, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] represents the abandonment of wisdom, squandering potential in favor of fleeting distractions. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], in turn, mocks The Scholar’s rigid discipline, believing that knowledge is meaningless if it is not paired with experience and joy. Though they do not hate each other, they are constant sources of irritation, neither able to understand the other’s perspective. Similarly, he finds himself at odds with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]], despite their shared appreciation for information. While The Scholar values knowledge as an unchanging foundation of truth, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] sees information as something to be traded, bartered, and used for profit. The Scholar resents the way [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] places value on adaptability over certainty, believing that truth is not something that should shift with the highest bidder.

Another source of frustration is [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], for where The Scholar seeks to understand the world through careful study, she relies on prophecy and visions, things that defy explanation. He is deeply skeptical of fate, preferring evidence and research over cryptic riddles and unknowable forces. To The Scholar, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]]’s prophecies are vague and unreliable, providing no room for proper analysis, while she sees his obsession with structured knowledge as a limitation, preventing him from accepting the truths beyond mortal comprehension. However, his greatest philosophical opposition lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], despite their shared love of preservation. The Scholar believes that knowledge must be recorded and shared, that history belongs to all who seek it. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], however, hoards wisdom and artifacts alike, locking them away for only a select few to access. To The Scholar, this is a great injustice—knowledge that is hidden might as well be destroyed. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], in turn, sees The Scholar’s open dissemination of information as reckless, believing that some truths are too dangerous to be freely given. Their conflict is one of preservation versus control, access versus secrecy, and neither will ever concede their stance.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Library of the Unwritten

In the age before written language, knowledge was fleeting, passed only from mouth to ear, fading with each retelling. It is said that The Scholar, seeing the fragility of mortal wisdom, built a great library beyond the reach of time itself—a place where every idea, every forgotten name, and every lost story still lingers, waiting to be rediscovered. He did not fill its shelves with tomes of his own making, nor did he guard its knowledge with magic or steel. Instead, he left its halls empty, save for one rule carved into its stone walls: "*What is forgotten here may be found again.*" It is said that those who seek wisdom beyond their grasp may find themselves in its endless corridors, wandering the quiet stacks, their hands tracing the spines of books that should not exist. But the library does not grant knowledge freely—only those who write their own understanding within its pages may take from it in return.

#### Sethis, the Questioner

Sethis was born into a world that demanded obedience, where knowledge was dictated and questions were forbidden. From childhood, he could not silence his curiosity—he questioned kings, scholars, priests, and even the stars themselves. Frustrated, they cast him out, calling him a heretic, a fool who would drown in his own doubt. But as he wandered, The Scholar walked beside him, guiding him to the ruins of civilizations long past, where answers and contradictions lay side by side. With each discovery, Sethis grew not more certain, but more willing to accept the unknown. In time, his name became legend, not as a keeper of knowledge, but as the one who taught others how to ask. To this day, philosophers invoke his name when faced with questions too vast to answer, and it is said that when a student asks the right question, The Scholar himself takes notice.

#### The Parable of the Empty Book

A young sage once sought The Scholar, believing himself worthy of all knowledge. He traveled far, braving storms and deserts, until at last, he found himself before the Ascendant, who sat before an open book. The sage bowed low and asked, "What is the greatest truth?" The Scholar smiled and turned the book toward him. The pages were blank. "*This is the sum of all wisdom,*" The Scholar said. The sage grew furious. "You mock me! There is nothing here!" The Scholar only nodded. "*Then write something worth reading.*" The sage left, still fuming, but as he traveled home, he found himself contemplating things he had never before considered. By the time he returned, he had filled his own books with ideas, reflections, and discoveries—none of them answers, but all of them truths. And so he understood: knowledge is not something received, but something sought, shaped, and passed forward.
