## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Fox
- **Icon**: Two Coins
- **Material**: Citrine
- **Moral Alignment**: Neutral Good
- **Common Worshipers**: Merchants, bankers, traders, artisans, diplomats, guild leaders, treasure hunters, and those who seek prosperity through skill and negotiation

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Merchant is revered by those who thrive on commerce, negotiation, and the art of exchange. Merchants and traders invoke his name before striking a deal, trusting in his favor to ensure prosperity. Artisans and craftsmen pray for good fortune, hoping their work will find eager buyers, while bankers and guild leaders look to his teachings to build lasting financial empires. Even among rulers, he has followers—kings and ministers who understand that a thriving economy is as powerful as any army.

Most of his worshipers lean neutral good, believing in fair trade and mutual prosperity, though his faith is broad enough to attract a variety of alignments. Lawful followers see commerce as a structured force that must be regulated for the benefit of all, while chaotic devotees embrace the thrill of risk, fortune, and the ever-changing tides of wealth. While some neutral and evil-aligned followers twist his teachings to justify greed, manipulation, or unchecked ambition, they often fail to grasp his core philosophy—wealth without purpose is worthless, and those who take without giving back will eventually find themselves empty-handed.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Merchant appears as a Lightfoot Halfling male, radiating effortless charm and warmth. His ruddy-gold skin glows faintly, like the first rays of morning light spilling over a bustling marketplace, inviting fortune and prosperity wherever he walks. His emerald-green eyes sparkle with laughter and knowing mischief, filled with the keen awareness of a man who can read a deal before it's even spoken. His smile is infectious, his expression always teetering on the edge of a jest or a wise remark, drawing people in like old friends sharing a drink at the end of a profitable day.

He is dressed in a finely tailored vest of deep green and gold, embroidered with symbols of ships, caravans, coins, and jewels, each stitch a mark of wealth in motion. Around his neck hang two small golden coins, polished to a gleam, seemingly catching and reflecting light even in the dimmest settings. His very presence exudes camaraderie and opportunity, making even the most hardened skeptic feel as though they’ve known him for years. Wherever he walks, there is a subtle hum of commerce—the faint clink of coins, the rustling of trade goods, the distant sound of bartering—as if prosperity itself lingers in his wake.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Merchant manifests where deals are made, bargains struck, and commerce shapes the world. He does not force outcomes, but his presence ensures that opportunities are seen and seized. When two traders stand at the precipice of an agreement, his unseen presence is the weight of certainty that pushes a handshake forward. When a merchant considers whether to extend credit, his silent influence settles the decision based on wisdom, not fear.

His presence is often felt in the steadying of a hand before a contract is signed, the moment of realization when a fairer deal can be reached, or the instinct to walk away when an agreement would lead to ruin. A merchant may not see him, but they know he was there in the moment their business thrived, when they recognized the true worth of a good, or when their words swayed a negotiation in their favor. The Merchant does not grant prosperity freely, nor does he take it away—he ensures that those who understand the value of exchange will always find their way to wealth.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Merchant sees mortals as the lifeblood of prosperity, not just as individuals seeking wealth, but as participants in the great exchange that binds society together. To him, commerce is not merely the transfer of coin—it is the forging of relationships, the art of negotiation, and the foundation upon which civilizations rise. He delights in their ambition, their cleverness, and their ability to turn nothing into something. A fair deal, a well-bargained trade, or a thriving marketplace is as sacred to him as any temple, and he finds joy in seeing mortals prosper through their own wit and diligence.

Though generous and warm-hearted, The Merchant is not blind to greed, deceit, and exploitation. He believes in competition as a path to greatness, rewarding those who succeed through cleverness and resourcefulness, but he despises those who hoard wealth without purpose or manipulate trade for their own selfish gain. Wealth should move, flow, and grow, and those who seek only to possess without creating, to take without giving back, are wasting the very thing that defines them. While he prefers generosity and fairness, he is not above turning the tables on those who think they can outmaneuver him—after all, every transaction is a game, and he never plays to lose.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Merchant teaches that wealth is meant to be shared, grown, and used to uplift others. A fortune hoarded is a fortune wasted, but a deal well-struck, a trade well-bargained, and a risk well-taken are sacred acts that shape the world as much as any ruler or army. He values honesty, cleverness, and loyalty, but understands that risk and ambition are the forces that keep society moving.

- **Tenets**
    1. Prosperity is meant to be shared. Hoarding wealth is as foolish as hoarding air.
    2. A fair deal benefits both parties. Deception in trade only leads to ruin.
    3. Every exchange is an opportunity. Know the worth of what you have and what you seek.
    4. Fortune favors the bold—take risks, but take them wisely.
    5. Success is not just in wealth, but in the connections you forge along the way.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Merchant and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] share a natural and prosperous alliance, for without trade, craftsmanship has no value, and without goods to sell, merchants have no trade. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] creates, refining raw materials into objects of beauty and utility, while The Merchant ensures those creations find eager buyers across the world. Their relationship is built on mutual benefit—neither could thrive without the other. Though they may argue over pricing and worth, they both recognize that wealth and creation go hand in hand. Similarly, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] and The Merchant are in constant cooperation, as negotiation and persuasion are at the heart of both their domains. The Merchant sees gold and goods as the universal language of agreement, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] ensures that trade routes remain open, treaties secure, and economies stable. While The Merchant values shrewd negotiation, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]]’s skill in smoothing tensions ensures that commerce is not disrupted by needless conflict.

The Merchant finds an unexpected ally in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], as luck and prosperity often go hand in hand. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]]’s indulgence fuels markets, bringing prosperity to taverns, festival vendors, and entertainers, all of whom thrive when wealth is spent freely. Though The Merchant may roll his eyes at [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]]’s lack of financial caution, he cannot deny that thriving trade follows in his wake. Likewise, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] acknowledges that fortune favors those who take risks, and The Merchant embodies that ideal, knowing that every deal, every investment, and every journey carries an element of chance. Meanwhile, The Merchant’s alliance with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] is more formal, yet no less vital. Contracts, agreements, and economic law all require enforcement, and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] ensures that deals are upheld and debts are honored. While The Merchant prefers flexibility in business, he understands that trust in commerce is only maintained when laws prevent fraud and deception from undermining trade.

#### Conflicts

Of all the Ascendants, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] is The Merchant’s most natural rival. The Merchant believes that wealth should flow, that prosperity is built on exchange, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] hoards riches, locking treasures away. The Merchant sees this as a waste, a refusal to let value move where it is needed. To him, a rare artifact collecting dust in a vault is worth nothing, while that same artifact, in the hands of a buyer willing to pay dearly for it, holds true worth. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], in turn, sees The Merchant as short-sighted, believing that true value is not in fleeting transactions but in preservation and control. Though they may find themselves cooperating when interests align, they are often engaged in an ongoing battle of accumulation versus circulation. His relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] is more nuanced—while The Merchant respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] and understands the necessity of rulership, he does not feel the same dependency on him that [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] has for him. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] relies on trade to sustain his kingdom, knowing that without commerce, economies falter and stability is threatened. The Merchant, however, sees trade as something that transcends borders and governments; to him, rulers come and go, but business will always continue. Still, he acknowledges [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]]’s importance, recognizing that strong leadership ensures roads are maintained, taxes remain manageable, and merchants can operate safely within his lands. While they may occasionally clash over tariffs, monopolies, and economic restrictions, their relationship remains one of pragmatic respect.

Another source of conflict lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], for The Merchant thrives on the unknown, on risk and calculated gambles, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] embodies fate and inevitability. To The Merchant, fate is nothing more than a fool’s excuse—every deal, every negotiation is an opportunity to shape one’s own future, not a path already decided. He refuses to believe that some outcomes are unavoidable, that fortune cannot be changed by clever hands and quick thinking. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], in turn, finds The Merchant’s obsession with chance reckless, knowing that some things, no matter how well one bargains, cannot be altered. Their tension is one of belief in control versus surrender to destiny, and neither will ever fully convince the other. Perhaps his most frustrating opposition is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]], though theirs is not a relationship of enmity but of constant philosophical dispute. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] believes that aid should be given freely, that medicine, healing, and care should not be limited by wealth or trade. The Merchant, however, sees the world in terms of value—resources are not infinite, and fair compensation ensures that goods and services remain available. He argues that without structure, the very supplies needed for healing would become scarce, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] believes that prioritizing wealth over well-being leads to exploitation. While they both seek to create stability, their views on how resources should be distributed remain fundamentally opposed, leading to an ongoing debate between compassion and economic sustainability.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The City of Golden Scales

Long ago, there was a city where every deal was fair, every trade just, and no merchant ever sought to swindle another. It was said that The Merchant himself had walked its streets, teaching its founders the sacred art of commerce—that prosperity is built not through greed, but through exchange, and that wealth must flow like a river, enriching all it touches. For generations, the city thrived, its markets bursting with goods from every corner of the world. But as time passed, greed took root. Merchants hoarded their wealth, trade became lopsided, and the balance that had once sustained the city was lost. One day, a foreign trader arrived, offering a chest filled with gold beyond measure. The city’s rulers, blinded by greed, accepted the gift without question. The moment they touched the gold, the city trembled, its foundations cracking, its markets collapsing into dust. The trader had vanished, and in his place, only a singular copper coin lay, etched with a singular statement: _A stagnant coin is worth nothing._

#### Marcellus the Unyielding

Marcellus was a merchant who never bartered. To him, every deal had a single, fair price, and he refused to haggle, believing that wealth gained through deception was wealth unworthy of keeping. Though many mocked him, calling him rigid and foolish, his reputation grew. Traders knew that a coin given to Marcellus was always well spent, and that to buy from him was to buy without doubt. One evening, a beggar approached him, asking for a single coin. Marcellus, as always, demanded a fair exchange, but the beggar had nothing to offer. "*I will give you a secret*," the beggar said. Curious, Marcellus agreed, and the beggar whispered in his ear. The next day, Marcellus vanished, his wealth untouched, his name fading into legend. Some say The Merchant himself had tested him, that the secret he had received was the knowledge that true fortune is not measured in gold, but in the mark one leaves upon the world.

#### The Parable of the Empty Scales

A wealthy noble once sought to cheat the market by placing hidden weights upon his scales, ensuring that he always received more than he paid for. He grew rich beyond measure, buying up land, ships, and titles, until there was nothing left for him to acquire. But when he placed his final coin upon the scales, they tipped wildly, sending his entire fortune cascading out of his coffers, spilling into the streets, scattering beyond his reach. Desperate, he cried out for The Merchant’s aid, begging for his wealth to be returned. The Merchant appeared, shaking his head. "*You sought only to take*," he said. "*Now you have nothing left to give.*" The noble wandered the streets, watching as others traded and prospered, yet he could never again hold a coin, for every piece of gold he touched curiously slipped out of his hands, as though well-oiled.
