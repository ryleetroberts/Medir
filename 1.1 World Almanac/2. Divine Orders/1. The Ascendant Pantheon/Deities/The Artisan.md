- **Common Worshipers**: Blacksmiths, architects, inventors, sculptors, tailors, jewelers, artisans, engineers, and anyone devoted to the act of creation

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Artisan is revered by those who shape the world with their hands, minds, and ingenuity. Craftsmen offer prayers before striking the first blow of a hammer, and inventors whisper his name as they sketch new blueprints. His followers believe that to create is to leave a lasting mark on the world, and thus, they honor him through their work. Temples to the Artisan are filled with workshops and creations instead of altars and idols, where his devotees labor tirelessly to refine their craft, knowing that every creation—no matter how small—brings them closer to divine perfection.

Though most of his followers lean toward neutral good, embracing the idea that creation should enrich the world, others interpret his teachings differently. Lawful followers see craftsmanship as an act of discipline and mastery, believing in precise techniques and generational knowledge. Chaotic followers see his inspiration in boundless experimentation, embracing radical innovation and the constant breaking of tradition. Even some neutral evil individuals claim his favor, hoarding their craft for wealth and power, though they misunderstand his true nature—he does not condone greed, only the passion for creation itself.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Artisan appears as a Rock Gnome male, his small stature overflowing with boundless energy, as though he is a living spark of ingenuity given form. His bronzed skin glows with the steady warmth of a forge at its peak, carrying the golden sheen of polished metal. His sharp, expressive eyes sparkle like cut gemstones and dart ceaselessly around as if absorbing every detail of his surroundings—always studying, always improving. His silver and copper-streaked hair, forever caught in a state of charming disarray, is dusted with soot and oil, a testament to endless hours of work.

He wears a fitted leather apron, worn but well-kept, adorned with countless pockets and straps, each holding a different tool that subtly shifts and rearranges itself, as though responding to his unspoken needs. His hands, small but deft, radiate golden sparks when he touches raw materials, the very essence of craft flowing through him. A faint, rhythmic mechanical whirring follows his movements, like the ticking of unseen gears turning within the universe itself. His voice is quick and excited, words tumbling over one another as he explains concepts, offers encouragement, or loses himself in the joy of an idea not yet fully formed.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Artisan manifests most often through sudden bursts of inspiration—a craftsman’s hand guided flawlessly through an intricate carving, a blacksmith’s forge burning hotter just when the metal needs it most, or an inventor solving an impossible equation in the dead of night. His presence is felt in the thrill of discovery, in the quiet hum of concentration, and in the joy of creation that makes the heart race. To his followers, these moments are sacred, gifts from the divine that must be honored through their work.

When he takes physical form outside of his Aspect, he often appears as a pair of hands made of golden light, working with impossible speed, shaping, mending, and refining. Sometimes, he is heard as the distant sound of hammering, clicking gears, or a brush stroking against canvas. To those who seek his guidance, he may leave half-finished blueprints in their dreams or cause materials to subtly shift into better alignment, as if nudging them toward a superior design. While he rarely speaks in these moments, his touch is unmistakable—a reminder that creation is both a craft and a calling.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Artisan views mortals as the truest reflection of his domain, their endless drive to build, shape, and innovate mirroring the divine spark within them. He does not see them as mere worshipers, but as fellow creators, each with the potential to leave something lasting in the world. He revels in their ingenuity, appearing at their sides when they craft something new, guiding their hands with unseen precision. Unlike other Ascendants who demand obedience or piety, the Artisan’s favor is won through effort and passion, not ritual—those who create for the love of it will always find his presence near.

Yet, while he delights in mortal craftsmanship, he is impatient with waste and stagnation. Those who squander potential, who create without purpose, or who cling to outdated methods out of fear rather than respect for tradition, frustrate him deeply. He does not tolerate laziness nor does he favor mindless repetition—creation must move forward. To him, every flaw is a lesson, every failure a step toward refinement. A craftsman who never breaks a tool is one who has never truly tested the limits of their craft.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Artisan teaches that creation is both an art and a responsibility—a craftsperson’s work should not only serve a function but inspire, endure, and improve upon what came before. He pushes his followers to embrace both precision and passion, to never fear innovation, and to treat their tools, materials, and knowledge as sacred. True mastery is not in reaching perfection, but in the endless pursuit of it.

- **Tenets**
    1. A creator’s work is never finished—there is always room to improve, refine, and perfect.
    2. Form and function must exist in harmony; even the most useful tool should hold beauty in its design.
    3. Waste is a sin. Every material, every failure, every broken piece has the potential for something greater.
    4. Never fear the new. Innovation is the heartbeat of creation, and stagnation is its death.
    5. The act of creation is sacred. Build not only for yourself but for the world you will leave behind.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Artisan finds his greatest inspiration in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]], for creation is meaningless without purpose, and purpose is what she provides. Where he fosters skill, she fosters vision, ensuring that the works of craftsmen, architects, and inventors are not just functional but meaningful. The Artisan sees [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]] as the muse that elevates mere craftsmanship into artistry, and in return, she values the way his hands bring form to inspiration. Likewise, he shares a strong bond with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], for civilization is built upon the foundation of craftsmanship, and progress demands both innovation and infrastructure. The Artisan provides the tools, the blueprints, and the expertise, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] ensures that his work is implemented, expanding cities, forging roads, and driving mortals ever forward. Without [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], The Artisan's work risks stagnation; without The Artisan, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]]’s vision remains unshaped.

Similarly, The Artisan and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] are deeply connected, for trade is the lifeblood that keeps craftsmanship thriving. Every masterpiece needs a patron, and every craft needs a market—[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] ensures that The Artisan’s works reach those who will cherish and use them. They both recognize the value of skill and ingenuity, knowing that the worth of an object is not just in its materials, but in the hands that shaped it. Equally, The Artisan finds kinship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]], for both seek refinement—one in craft, the other in knowledge. They exchange expertise freely, with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] preserving the techniques and discoveries of past generations, ensuring that no innovation is lost to time. The Artisan, in turn, pushes [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] to consider the practical applications of knowledge, preventing theory from remaining trapped within books.

#### Conflicts

Despite their similarities, The Artisan harbors a complicated relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]], appreciating his dedication to preserving that which is valuable while despising his tendency to hoard greatness without purpose. The Artisan believes that every creation is meant to be used, appreciated, and further refined, yet [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Collector]] seals his treasures away, locking away masterworks that could elevate civilization if only they were in the right hands. To The Artisan, a painting unseen, a tool unused, or an invention wasted in a vault is a betrayal of creation itself. His frustrations extend to [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]], though not out of rejection of arcane power. The Artisan respects magic as a force of wonder, but he resents how [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]] and his followers often bypass craftsmanship, conjuring with a flick of the wrist what should take years of skill to master. He sees it as a shortcut, a means of circumventing the discipline that true artisans must endure. Magic can enhance craft, but to replace it entirely is to devalue the very act of creation.

More adversarial is his relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], whose pursuit of hidden knowledge is often reckless and dismissive of the craftsmanship required to preserve the past. While The Artisan understands the desire to uncover lost techniques and ancient wonders, he is infuriated when [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] prioritizes discovery over preservation, leaving priceless relics damaged or lost in the pursuit of their secrets. The Artisan believes that true understanding comes from careful study, not tearing apart the past in a desperate bid to claim its knowledge. However, his greatest ideological opposition lies with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]], whose embrace of fate and prophecy undermines everything he stands for. The Artisan believes in progress, in shaping the world with one’s own hands, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] whispers of inevitability, of destinies already set in stone. To him, there is no greater insult than the notion that all things are predetermined, that no amount of skill or effort can change what is to come. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] sees the grand design of the cosmos, but The Artisan refuses to accept that any creation—including the future—should be beyond the reach of mortal hands.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The City That Would Not Fall

When an ancient stood on the brink of destruction, its walls cracked and its foundations trembling beneath a relentless siege, its rulers turned not to warriors, but to the hands of its craftsmen. They prayed to The Artisan, offering their tools and their skill in exchange for his guidance. And The Artisan answered. He did not strike down the invaders, nor did he raise new walls by divine will—instead, he appeared in the dreams of the city’s artisans, guiding their hands in their most desperate hour. They reinforced the city with ingenious supports, redirected rivers to flood enemy tunnels, and crafted weapons that turned the tide of battle. When the dust settled, the city still stood—not because of gods or warriors, but because its people had built something that could not be broken. It is said that to this day, the city’s gates bear an inscription written by The Artisan himself: _Strength is in what you create, not what you destroy._

#### Veylen the Boundless

Veylen was born into a family of builders but yearned for more than tradition—he wished to create something new, something that had never been seen before. But every time he presented his ideas, the elders of his guild scoffed, calling him reckless, warning that tradition must not be discarded for the sake of ambition. Frustrated but determined, Veylen prayed to The Artisan for guidance. In response, The Artisan did not give him approval—he gave him a challenge. If Veylen could forge something worthy of legend, something that would inspire generations after him, The Artisan would bless his name. And so, Veylen spent decades perfecting his craft, studying not just stone and metal, but magic, philosophy, and art. His final creation was a bridge unlike any other—one that spanned across time itself, existing in multiple places at once, allowing those with vision to step beyond their limits. When The Artisan saw it, he did not grant Veylen a simple blessing—he made him immortal, for a creation without limits deserved a creator to match.

#### The Parable of the Broken Chisel

A sculptor once prayed to The Artisan, asking for the perfect chisel, one that would never dull, never break, and never fail. Suddenly, The Artisan appeared before him and placed a chisel of flawless craftsmanship in his hands. In reverence, the sculptor worked tirelessly, marveling at how the tool never faltered. Yet, as time passed, he found that his work had lost something—a spark, an imperfection that once gave it life. Frustrated, he confronted The Artisan, demanding to know why his creations no longer inspired. The Artisan only smiled and took the chisel from him, breaking it in half with his bare hands. “Perfection is not creation,” he said. “A tool that does not challenge you will never teach you. Growth is found in struggle, not in flawlessness.” From that day forward, the sculptor embraced his mistakes, knowing that true mastery comes not from never failing, but from learning how to shape failure into something beautiful.
