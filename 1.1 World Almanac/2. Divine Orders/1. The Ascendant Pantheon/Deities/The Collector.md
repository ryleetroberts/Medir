# **The Collector (Wealth, Preservation, Ambition)**

## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Dragon
- **Icon**: Chest
- **Material**: Ivory
- **Moral Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Common Worshipers**: Merchants, treasure hunters, nobles, bankers, archivists, scholars of rare lore, collectors of relics and artifacts

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Collector is worshiped by those who seek to gather, preserve, and accumulate—be it wealth, artifacts, knowledge, or influence. Merchants pray to him before a lucrative deal, and treasure hunters offer him tribute before delving into forgotten ruins. Nobles and rulers invoke his name as they amass wealth, while scholars devoted to lost histories may seek his favor in their pursuit of knowledge. His temples are not places of prayer, but vaults, archives, and repositories, where the most valuable and rare treasures of the world are safeguarded in his name.

Most of his followers lean lawful neutral, believing that wealth and power must be maintained with structure and control. Lawful good adherents see him as a patron of preservation, ensuring that the world’s greatest treasures—both material and intellectual—are protected from those who would squander them. Lawful evil devotees, however, view his doctrine as justification for dominion, hoarding power and wealth for themselves, believing that ownership alone defines worth. While the Collector does not outright condemn greed, he despises waste, and those who amass without purpose are unworthy of his favor.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Collector appears as a towering Dragonborn, his presence an overwhelming display of opulence, dominion, and unshakable possession. His scales are in constant flux, shifting seamlessly between chromatic, metallic, and gem hues, creating a mesmerizing spectacle of radiant splendor. Each color gleams with a richness beyond mortal material, as if he alone holds dominion over every type of dragon’s might. His ivory claws and horns gleam like sculpted marble, each point sharpened to perfection, a reminder that even beauty can be a weapon when wielded with intent. His eyes burn with molten amber light, their depth holding the weight of treasures accumulated over countless ages.

Draped over his broad shoulders is a flowing cloak of deep crimson, its edges adorned with intricately embroidered interlocked coins and gemstones. The gold-threaded patterns shift subtly, the images rearranging themselves in endless configurations of trade, conquest, and accumulation. His voice rumbles like shifting mountains of gold, resonant with the allure of promises unspoken and riches beyond mortal comprehension.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Collector most often manifests through moments of acquisition and preservation—when a great hoard is gathered, when a lost artifact is unearthed, or when wealth or knowledge is passed from one worthy steward to another. Those who earn his favor might feel a sudden warmth in their hands as they lay claim to something of immense value, while those who would squander a treasure may feel an unseen weight upon them, as if the Collector himself is weighing their worth.

In moments of divine necessity or wrath, he takes the form of a colossal dragon, his shifting scales expanding into an impenetrable armor of living metal. His roar is a cascade of crashing gold and breaking stone, shaking the ground and sending echoes through time itself. The sheer gravity of his presence drains light and sound, forcing all who stand before him to acknowledge that power is not merely taken—it is kept, guarded, and held with purpose.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Collector views mortals as both stewards and challengers, individuals who either prove their worth through acquisition or fail by allowing value to slip through their grasp. He does not see them as his subjects, nor does he pity their struggles—he sees them as players in an eternal game of accumulation, where ambition is the only true measure of success. To him, those who understand the weight of ownership, the significance of preservation, and the pursuit of wealth or knowledge are worthy of his gaze. Those who squander opportunity, fail to recognize value, or allow history to be lost are beneath his notice.

While mortals may think of him as a patron of greed, his desires run deeper. The Collector is not driven by mere hoarding, but by the eternal pursuit of worth. A treasure without a story is just metal, a kingdom without legacy is dust, and a scholar without preservation is a fool. He rewards those who claim, guard, and understand the value of what they possess, but he does not abide waste. A ruler who hoards gold yet lets their city crumble is a disgrace. A merchant who gains wealth but fails to expand their influence is unworthy. To The Collector, value must be recognized, protected, and used to shape the world.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Collector teaches that wealth, knowledge, and power are nothing without purpose—to own is not enough; one must understand, protect, and expand what they claim. He does not care for reckless greed, nor does he tolerate weakness masquerading as virtue. His followers are expected to seek, acquire, and preserve not only riches but the stories, legacies, and influence that come with them.

- **Tenets**
    1. That which is valuable must be claimed—lost wealth, forgotten knowledge, and abandoned power serve no one.
    2. Ownership is sacred. What is truly yours should never be squandered or surrendered without purpose.
    3. A treasure without history is nothing more than a trinket. Seek the stories behind what you collect.
    4. Expansion is survival. To hoard without growth is to stagnate, and stagnation is death.
    5. The world belongs to those who are worthy of keeping it. Claim, protect, and build upon what is rightfully yours.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Collector’s closest alliance is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], for both understand that knowledge—like wealth—has power, and that power is best wielded by those who claim it first. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] unearths forgotten relics and hidden truths, while The Collector ensures they are preserved, protected, and, when necessary, leveraged. Though their methods differ—[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] seeks knowledge for discovery, while The Collector gathers it for control—they recognize in each other the same relentless pursuit of value. Similarly, he finds kinship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]], who, like him, is dedicated to ensuring that nothing of worth is lost. While [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Scholar]] preserves knowledge for posterity, The Collector ensures that the most valuable artifacts, histories, and treasures are safeguarded, even if it means locking them away. They both understand that true value is not merely in possession, but in protection from those who would misuse or destroy it.

He also shares an alliance with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], for rulership and wealth are inextricably tied. A kingdom cannot function without a treasury, and a ruler without resources is a ruler in name only. The Collector ensures that [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] has the means to maintain order and authority, offering wealth, influence, and economic stability in return for protection and opportunity. Likewise, he finds a pragmatic ally in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]], as influence is often measured in gold as much as in words. The Collector understands that wealth can open doors that strength alone cannot, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] recognizes that securing economic power can be just as critical as forging alliances. They both play the long game, ensuring that power remains in the hands of those who understand how to wield it.

#### Conflicts

Despite their mutual reliance, The Collector harbors a subtle rivalry with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]]. While they both deal in wealth, their philosophies clash—[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] believes in the movement of goods, in trade, and in the prosperity that comes from an active economy, while The Collector hoards, seeing wealth as something to be amassed and preserved rather than endlessly circulated. Yet, they recognize that they need each other; without trade, The Collector would have nothing to acquire, and without collectors, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] would have nothing of worth to sell. His tension with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]] is more pronounced, as The Collector’s tendency to hoard creations offends [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]]’s belief that all works should be seen, used, and improved upon. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Artisan]], locking away a masterpiece is akin to stifling innovation, while The Collector argues that some things are too valuable to risk losing to time, damage, or unworthy hands.

One of his greater conflicts is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], who rejects the very notion of possession without indulgence. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]], wealth should be spent, fine wine should be drunk, and beauty should be admired rather than hidden away in a vault. The Collector, however, believes that excess leads to waste, and that true value lies in possession, not in fleeting enjoyment. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] mocks this belief, seeing The Collector as a miser who gathers treasures only to let them gather dust. In turn, The Collector views [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Reveler]] as foolish, throwing away fortune and legacy in pursuit of momentary pleasure. Above all, The Collector finds his greatest opposition in [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]], whose philosophy stands in direct contrast to his own. Where The Collector hoards, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] gives freely. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] believes in using knowledge, resources, and aid to help others, while The Collector sees such generosity as wasteful sentimentality. He cannot fathom the logic of healing the sick without securing a return, of giving away knowledge without ensuring control, of expending resources on those who may never repay their debt. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]], in turn, sees The Collector’s greed as a sickness—one that withholds what could be used to better the world. Their conflict is not one of mere ideology, but of fundamental belief: is value measured by possession or by use? The Collector refuses to relinquish what he has claimed, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Healer]] refuses to let anything of worth be hoarded while others suffer.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The Jewel of a Hundred Hands

The Jewel of a Hundred Hands was said to be the most valuable gemstone ever unearthed, its many facets reflecting not just light, but the desires of those who gazed upon it. For centuries, it passed through the hands of kings, merchants, and thieves, each believing they had finally claimed it. Yet, no owner kept it for long—fortunes crumbled, dynasties fell, and thieves found themselves betrayed by their own greed. It was said that The Collector himself had blessed the gem, not as a gift, but as a lesson. In time, the Jewel vanished from history, as if it had never existed. Some believe The Collector took it back into his vault, a final reminder that wealth is never truly owned—only borrowed, until someone more worthy comes along.

#### Erian the Hoarder

Erian the Hoarder was not chosen by The Collector for wealth, but for vision. Born into nothing, he amassed a fortune not by conquest, but by gathering what others overlooked—forgotten relics, lost knowledge, broken artifacts that no one else saw value in. He built a grand archive, a sanctuary of history where the rare and the priceless were safeguarded, not for his own glory, but so that they would never be lost. When rivals sought to take his treasures for themselves, The Collector tested him, whispering that he could save only one item before his vault burned. Without hesitation, Erian chose an unassuming ledger—an inventory of all he had gathered, proof that even if his collection was destroyed, its memory would endure. The Collector smiled upon him then, for only one who understood that worth extends beyond possession was worthy of his favor.

#### The Parable of the Avaricious Noble

An already rich noble once sought The Collector’s favor, praying for limitless wealth. The Ascendant appeared before him and granted his wish, turning everything he touched into gold. At first, the noble rejoiced, believing himself the richest man alive. But soon, he found himself alone—his food, his home, even his loved ones became lifeless treasure in his hands. Desperate, he begged The Collector to take the gift back, but the god only shook his head. “You wished for wealth,” he said, “but you never defined its worth.” The noble’s story is retold as a warning—that fortune, if sought without wisdom, can become its own prison.
