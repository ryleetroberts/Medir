- **Common Worshipers**: Seers, diviners, mystics, scholars of prophecy, astronomers, monks, and those who seek hidden knowledge

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The Oracle is revered by those who peer beyond the present, seeking to unravel the threads of fate and glimpse the unknown. Diviners and mystics offer prayers before their rituals, hoping to catch a clearer vision of what lies ahead. Scholars of prophecy pore over ancient texts dedicated to her wisdom, while astronomers search the skies for signs of her influence in celestial alignments. Her followers do not seek control over destiny, but understanding—they do not ask what will happen, but what may.

Most of her worshipers lean neutral, recognizing that knowledge is not inherently good or evil, but shaped by those who wield it. Lawful followers keep records of past prophecies and seek to use them to guide civilizations, while chaotic devotees embrace her wisdom as a force of possibility, believing that fate is meant to be disrupted and reshaped. Some see her as a source of enlightenment, while others fear her prophecies as omens of inescapable doom. To all, she is a voice from beyond time, one that speaks not in answers, but in questions waiting to be understood.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The Oracle appears as a waif-like human woman, delicate and ethereal, as if she is only partially bound to the mortal realm. Her alabaster-pale skin is almost translucent, glowing faintly with a silvery-white light that pulses in rhythm with an unseen heartbeat, a silent echo of something far beyond the present moment. Her impossibly long, flowing hair cascades far beyond her feet, a river of liquid starlight, shifting and drifting as though caught in the unseen currents of time itself.

Her pupil-less eyes swirl with silver mist, ever-shifting, giving the impression that they do not look at the world, but through it—into the infinite possibilities that stretch beyond the now. She wears a simple, flowing gown of pure white, its edges embroidered with faint silver markings, abstract symbols that seem to subtly rearrange themselves when unobserved. When she prophesies or exerts her influence, a luminous third eye appears above her brow, radiating an intense silver light and spinning slowly, as though it watches the unraveling threads of fate itself.

### **Manifestation Style**

The Oracle almost never manifests in the waking world, instead reaching mortals through dreams, cryptic visions, and glimpses of possibilities yet to unfold. Her presence is felt in the flicker of an image seen in a mirror, a whisper carried on the wind that is gone before it can be fully understood, or a fragmented dream that lingers upon waking—half-remembered, yet impossible to forget. Those who receive her visions rarely comprehend their full meaning in the moment, for she does not provide answers, only questions waiting to be unraveled.

Only in the most profound moments of fate, when a single soul stands at the precipice of history, does she appear in her full Aspect. To stand before her is to feel as if time itself has folded inward, as if every possibility, every version of oneself, exists in the same breath. Those who witness her true form do not merely hear prophecy; they are woven into it, their role in what is to come solidified in a way they may not yet understand. Even after she vanishes, mirrors may reflect things that are not there, candle flames may flicker in unseen wind, and choices may feel heavier, as though destiny itself has taken notice.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The Oracle sees mortals not as individuals, but as threads woven into an ever-shifting tapestry of fate. She does not view them with warmth nor with indifference—she simply sees. Their choices ripple outward, their destinies forming patterns long before they unfold, and she watches as they struggle against what has already been set into motion. To her, they are both free and bound, both masters of their choices and prisoners of the paths laid before them.

She cares for them in a way that is difficult to define, for she is not a guide nor a protector, but a witness. She does not intervene unless fate demands it, and even then, her actions are not driven by sentiment but by necessity. To mortals, she may seem distant, unknowable—a figure who understands them more deeply than they understand themselves yet offers them no clear path forward. Though she may bestow prophecy, she does so without explanation, for true knowledge is not in answers, but in the act of seeking them.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The Oracle teaches that the future is both written and unwritten, that destiny is a paradox meant to be understood, not controlled. Knowledge is power, but power does not always mean action. Those who seek her wisdom must understand that truth is not given—it is revealed only to those who are willing to see beyond what they wish to be true.

- **Tenets**
    1. The future is neither fixed nor free—it is both. Accept this, and understanding will follow.
    2. A prophecy is not a command, nor a promise. It is a possibility waiting to be shaped.
    3. Do not fear what is unknown; fear only the refusal to seek understanding.
    4. Truth does not belong to any one being. It must be found, protected, and passed on.
    5. Knowledge carries responsibility—those who seek must be willing to bear its weight.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The Oracle shares a profound connection with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]], as prophecy and civilization are deeply intertwined. Great movements in history—revolutions, discoveries, the rise and fall of empires—are often foreseen long before they happen. The Oracle sees these moments unfold before they come to pass, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] ensures they are acted upon, driving history forward. While [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Torchbearer]] believes in ambition and progress, The Oracle reminds him that not all change can be controlled, and some events are destined to happen no matter how hard mortals fight against them. Likewise, she holds a deep affinity with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], for those who are best equipped to handle her cryptic messages are those most comfortable navigating the unknown. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] and his followers often seek out The Oracle’s visions, not to change fate, but to uncover truths hidden within destiny’s weave. The Oracle respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]]’s patience and ability to interpret mystery, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]] values her as one of the greatest sources of hidden knowledge.

She also finds kinship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]], for enlightenment and prophecy often walk the same path. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]] helps mortals navigate their purpose, offering guidance through wisdom, while The Oracle reveals the shape of things to come. Though [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]] believes in free will, she acknowledges that understanding fate can be a form of enlightenment, while The Oracle respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]]’s ability to lead people toward their own understanding of their place in the grand design. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]] is another unlikely ally, as he stands as the master of arcane forces that defy mortal understanding. Though [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]] rejects rigid structure, he recognizes that fate itself is a force not unlike magic—complex, layered, and often beyond comprehension. The Oracle, in turn, sees [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]] as someone who can glimpse the underlying currents of destiny, even if he refuses to acknowledge their inevitability. While they may not always agree on the nature of prophecy, they both embrace the idea that reality is far greater than what most mortals perceive.

#### Conflicts

One of The Oracle’s most persistent struggles is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], whose belief in absolute rule stands in opposition to her visions of shifting destinies. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]] believes in control, in leadership that is upheld by strength and stability, while The Oracle reminds him that no throne is eternal. She speaks of rulers who will rise and fall, of empires that will crumble regardless of how well they are governed. This frustrates [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The King]], who sees such declarations as dangerous self-fulfilling prophecies. Though he does not deny The Oracle’s power, he resents the idea that his rule—or any rule—is dictated by fate rather than by a leader’s will. Similarly, she finds herself in frequent conflict with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], who believes that any future can be shaped through careful planning and preparation. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]]’s entire philosophy is built on the idea that no outcome is inevitable, that strategy and foresight can prevent disaster. The Oracle, however, sees the patterns of fate unfold despite mortal intervention, and no amount of preparation can change what is meant to be. Their struggle is one of ideology—[[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] fights against the currents of destiny, while The Oracle simply watches them carry events toward their destined conclusion.

Another force of opposition comes in the form of [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], who believes in absolute law and order, a stark contrast to The Oracle’s acceptance of fate’s ever-shifting design. Where [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] sees justice as a fixed principle, The Oracle knows that morality is often dictated by events outside of mortal control. She frustrates [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] by revealing truths that challenge the rigidity of law, visions of scenarios where the “right” course of action is not always clear. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], prophecy is dangerous, for it suggests that some outcomes are unavoidable, even when justice demands otherwise. Lastly, The Oracle’s greatest philosophical divide is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]], whose belief in free will and negotiation directly contradicts her visions of destiny. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] thrives on risk, on forging new paths through clever deals and bold decisions, while The Oracle sees the inevitable weight of fate pulling events toward their conclusion. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] rejects the idea that the future is predetermined, while The Oracle watches as his every gamble plays out exactly as it was always meant to. Their conflict is not hostile, but it is deeply ingrained—one of inevitability versus agency, fate versus free will.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The City That Never Fell

In ages past, a city stood at the edge of ruin, its enemies closing in, its people resigned to their inevitable fall. The rulers sought counsel from The Oracle, climbing to her hidden sanctuary to beg for salvation. She did not grant them an army, nor did she offer them a weapon to strike down their foes. Instead, she whispered a single sentence: "*The city that moves does not break*." Confused, the rulers returned, unsure of her meaning, until one among them, a humble cartwright, understood. That night, the city’s people dismantled their homes, loading them onto wagons, and under the cover of darkness, they left their land behind. When their enemies arrived at dawn, they found nothing but empty streets, the city they had sought to conquer now nothing more than a whisper on the wind. It is said that those who listen closely can still hear the wheels turning in the distance, for the city never stopped moving, forever carried forward by those who refused to be broken.

#### Orlen, the Dream-Walker

Orlen was born beneath a sky filled with falling stars, and from the moment he could speak, he described visions of things that had not yet come to pass. Though feared by many, he was blessed by The Oracle, his mind drifting between past, present, and future. No lock could keep him out, for he always knew where the key would be. No riddle could fool him, for he had heard the answer before the question was asked. He wandered the world, never staying in one place for long, his footsteps always a half-second ahead of fate. Yet, for all his knowledge, there was one thing he never revealed—the day and manner of his own death. When at last the moment came, he smiled, as though greeting an old friend, and vanished without a trace, leaving behind only his well-worn sandals.

#### The Parable of the Sealed Door

A young scholar, desperate for enlightenment, journeyed to The Oracle’s temple and found before it a single door with no key. He spent years searching for a way inside, consulting sages, reading ancient texts, and crafting tools to break through, but the door would not yield. At last, in despair, he sank to the ground and whispered, "I will never know what lies beyond." At that moment, The Oracle’s voice filled the air. "*Then you are ready to enter.*" The door swung open, revealing a vast library filled with knowledge beyond imagining. The scholar, overjoyed, stepped forward—but as he did, he glanced back and saw that the door had never been locked. It had been open all along, waiting for him to stop searching for the key and start walking through.
