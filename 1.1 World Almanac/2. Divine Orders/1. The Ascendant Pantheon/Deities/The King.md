# **The King (Rulership, Authority, Oaths)**

## **Overview**

- **Animal**: Lion
- **Icon**: Crown
- **Material**: Gold
- **Moral Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Common Worshipers**: Monarchs, military commanders, judges, noble families, oath-bound knights, and bureaucrats

### **General Worship & Alignment**

The King is most commonly revered by those who rule, govern, or enforce order. Monarchs and noble houses invoke his name in coronations, treaties, and declarations of war, while judges and lawmakers see him as the enforcer of divine justice. Oath-bound warriors, such as knights and paladins, swear their loyalty before his symbol, believing that a broken vow invites his divine wrath.

Lawful Good worshipers see The King as a benevolent sovereign, guiding rulers to lead with wisdom and justice. Lawful Neutral followers uphold his ideal of absolute structure, believing that hierarchy and order must be preserved regardless of morality. Lawful Evil devotees venerate him as a patron of dominance, where might makes right, and those in power have the divine right to rule without question.

## **Divine Appearance & Presence**

### **Aspect Appearance**

The King manifests as a towering Human male, his golden-hued skin gleaming like polished metal, exuding a warmth akin to the first light of dawn. His eyes blaze like twin suns, their radiance carrying the weight of judgment and sovereignty. His hair, ever-shifting between molten gold to burnished copper, hangs to his chin. A crown of pure and radiant gold floats above his head, its fifteen different inlays subtly pulsing in resonance with the Ascendants' will.

Draped over his broad shoulders is a majestic cloak woven from the night sky itself, its dark fabric scattered with shifting constellations. The ground beneath his feet subtly reshapes itself, cracking and reforming, as if the very land acknowledges his dominion. When he speaks, his voice does not echo—it resounds, like a decree carved into the foundations of reality, compelling all who hear it to listen.

### **Manifestation Style**

The King manifests most often as his Aspect, fully formed and unmistakable. Unlike many Ascendants who shroud their divinity or appear in fleeting visions, The King arrives with the full weight of his authority. His presence is not an omen or a whisper—it is an event. When he manifests, the air grows thick with the gravity of his dominion, and all who stand before him feel the burden of their own oaths and power. The ground beneath his feet does not tremble, but it settles, as if the world itself acknowledges his claim. His lion often walks at his side, silent and watchful, a reminder that leadership is both privilege and responsibility.

The King most often manifests in moments of transition—when power is taken, when it is relinquished, or when a ruler’s claim is tested. A newly crowned monarch may feel a sudden stillness in the air, a silent presence weighing upon their shoulders, measuring their worth. A warlord declaring dominion over conquered lands may catch a glimpse of a golden-eyed lion at the edges of the battlefield, marking the moment as one that will be judged in the annals of history. He does not often interfere directly, for rulership must be earned, but his presence alone is enough to remind all who see him that a throne is not merely a seat—it is a burden that cannot be cast aside.

## **Personality & Philosophy**

### **View of Mortals & The World**

The King sees mortals as both the foundation and the test of rulership—they are not merely subjects to be governed, but the very measure of a leader’s worth. He does not view them with sentimentality, nor does he regard them as insignificant. Rather, he acknowledges that the greatness of a ruler is not determined by their own strength alone, but by the prosperity, order, and legacy they leave behind. He does not interfere lightly, believing that true sovereignty must be upheld by the will of mortals themselves. A ruler who cannot hold their throne does not deserve it. A leader who does not bear their responsibilities fully will feel the weight of their oaths break them.

To those who rule wisely, he is a silent patron, a steady presence that neither coddles nor abandons. To those who seize power through deception or weakness, he is an unseen force pressing down upon them, ensuring that the weight of their unearned crown becomes their undoing. Unlike [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], who ensures law and judgment are carried out impartially, The King does not correct injustices nor punish tyrants—he ensures that their own rule will. In this way, his will is both ever-present and distant, an inevitable force that shapes the fates of rulers, yet never bends to mortal whim.

### **Philosophy & Tenets**

The King teaches that rulership is not a privilege, but a sacred duty that must be upheld with strength, wisdom, and unwavering resolve. A throne is not merely a seat of power—it is a burden that must be carried until death. Leadership demands sacrifice, and only those willing to bear its weight should ever claim it. He does not concern himself with kindness or morality, only with competence, stability, and the fulfillment of one's oaths. A ruler who fails their people, who breaks their word, or who allows chaos to erode their domain is unworthy and will inevitably be undone by their own weakness. Those who follow him are expected to understand that power is a responsibility, and that authority, once claimed, must be held with both strength and wisdom.

- **Tenets**
	1. A throne once taken must never be abandoned. Leadership is a burden that does not end until death.
	2. An oath sworn is an oath kept. A ruler’s word is the foundation upon which kingdoms rise or fall.
	3. Strength and wisdom must walk hand in hand. Rule with force alone, and you will rule nothing. Rule with wisdom alone, and you will be deposed.
	4. Stability is the highest duty of a ruler. A kingdom in disorder is a kingdom already lost.
	5. Power is neither good nor evil, but it must be earned. To claim what is not yours by right is to invite ruin.

### **Alliances & Conflicts**

#### Alliances

The King’s strongest alliance is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]], for rulership and strategy are inseparable. While The King embodies the authority of leadership, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] ensures that rule is executed with precision, foresight, and discipline. The King values her calculated approach to governance and war, knowing that even the mightiest sovereign is nothing without a plan. In turn, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Tactician]] respects The King’s ability to command loyalty and maintain order, recognizing that strategy without rulership is merely an exercise in theory. Their partnership ensures that power is not only seized but wielded wisely. Just as vital is The King’s alliance with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]], for law and sovereignty must walk hand in hand. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]] enforces the structure that allows kingdoms to endure, ensuring that rulers remain bound by the very oaths that grant them legitimacy. The King does not see himself as above the law, but rather as the highest executor of it, and he values [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Arbiter]]’s unwavering commitment to justice, even when her rigid interpretation of the law can, at times, make rulership more complicated than he would like.

The King also shares a mutual respect with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]], for governance is as much about negotiation as it is about authority. While The King represents stability and command, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] ensures that power is maintained through careful alliances and calculated words rather than constant war. The two often work in tandem—where The King’s presence demands obedience, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] ensures that loyalty is freely given rather than begrudgingly forced. However, their methods are not always aligned; The King prefers decisive action, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Diplomat]] seeks to extend negotiations longer than The King’s patience will allow. Similarly, The King maintains an essential, if sometimes strained, relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]], for no kingdom can thrive without a strong economy. Trade, taxation, and prosperity are the lifeblood of any domain, and [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]] ensures that wealth flows where it is needed. The King values his ability to bring fortune to a realm, though he occasionally finds [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Merchant]]’s obsession with profit to be at odds with the dignity of rule.

#### Conflicts

While The King does not consider any among the Ascendants to be in true opposition, he often finds himself at odds with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], whose relentless pursuit of hidden knowledge is at best a nuisance and at worst a threat to stability. The King believes that while wisdom is necessary for leadership, there are some truths best left undiscovered, for the unearthing of buried secrets can fracture alliances, shake faith in rulers, or unravel hard-earned peace. [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]], in contrast, sees the suppression of knowledge as a form of control, something The King should have no right to impose. Though the two rarely come into direct conflict, [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Seeker]]’s habit of uncovering dangerous truths—secrets that could undo oaths, expose corruption, or call into question the legitimacy of rulers—makes The King wary of his influence. Likewise, The King finds [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] to be an enigmatic and frustrating presence, for prophecy and foresight challenge the very idea of rulership as a craft of decisions and strategy. The King believes in action, in shaping the future through will and strength, while [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Oracle]] exists as a passive observer, speaking in riddles of what is “meant to be.” He does not deny her power, nor does he dismiss prophecy outright, but he resents the notion that fate is immutable, and he refuses to let the weight of destiny override the duty of rule.

Another of The King’s lesser conflicts is with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]], whose chaotic nature and love for unrestrained magic clashes with The King’s ideals of order and structure. Magic, in The King’s eyes, is a force that must be harnessed and controlled, wielded responsibly rather than recklessly experimented with. He respects [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]]’s knowledge, for wisdom is a necessity of rule, but he disapproves of his disregard for structure, finding his approach to magic dangerously ungoverned. To [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Magus]], The King’s obsession with control is stifling, a needless limitation on what could be accomplished if mortals were allowed to explore magic freely. While they are not outright enemies, their ideologies remain at odds. Lastly, The King has a complicated relationship with [[zzz_GitRepo/1.1 World Almanac/2. Divine Orders/1. The Ascendant Pantheon/Deities/The Luminary]], for while he values her role as a source of inspiration and faith, he sees her influence as abstract, intangible, and often disconnected from the realities of rulership. While her ideals of unity and spiritual enlightenment are noble, The King believes that true leadership is not about divine radiance or moral purity—it is about action, responsibility, and the weight of command. He acknowledges her importance in guiding the hearts of the people but grows frustrated when her followers prioritize devotion over duty. To The King, a ruler must lead not with symbols or ideals, but with decisive will and unwavering control.

## **Mythology & Divine Powers**

### **Historical Influence & Myths**

#### The First Crown

Before thrones were carved and crowns were forged, warlords ruled by the strength of their arms alone, and power was fleeting. No ruler could hold their domain for long before another rose to take it. But when a particularly wise warrior carved out a kingdom and sought to make his rule endure beyond his own lifetime, he prayed to The King for guidance. In answer, The King appeared to him—not with a sword, but with a question: _"Do you seek to rule, or do you seek to reign?"_ The wise warrior did not understand, so The King gave him three days to find the answer. On the first day, the wise warrior rode to his armies, believing strength was his answer, but he saw that his soldiers obeyed him only as long as he held power. On the second day, he rode to his treasuries, believing wealth would secure his rule, but gold only bought loyalty that faded when the coin was spent. On the third day, he rode to the people, listening to their needs, their struggles, and their hopes for the future. And there, he found his answer. When The King returned, the wise warrior spoke: _"To reign is to sit upon a throne. To rule is to serve those who built it."_ Pleased, The King placed upon the wise warrior's head the first true crown—a simple band of unbroken gold, signifying rule not by force or wealth, but by duty. The wise warrior's dynasty endured for generations, and it is said that those who rule with wisdom still feel the weight of The King’s unseen hand upon their shoulders.

#### Sir Aric, the Oathbound Knight

Sir Aric was a warrior who swore fealty to a kingdom that no longer existed. When his king fell in battle and the royal line was extinguished, others told him that his duty had ended. But Aric knew otherwise—his oath had not been to a man, but to the ideals his king had upheld. And so, when warlords and usurpers carved the land apart, Sir Aric stood alone, carrying no banner but his vow. The King watched with silent approval, for true loyalty does not waver with shifting crowns. Over the years, others were drawn to Aric, not by the promise of wealth or title, but by the certainty of his resolve. He rebuilt the shattered kingdom not through conquest, but through devotion, guiding it back to strength with an unwavering hand. Even as he aged, his body worn and scarred, his voice never faltered, for The King had blessed him—not with strength, but with endurance, so that his oath would outlast his mortal flesh. When at last he passed, his sword was buried in the throne itself, a reminder that rule must always rest upon the foundation of duty.

#### The Parable of the Hollow Crown

A young prince, newly crowned, once asked The King to bless his rule with strength. The King appeared before him and placed a golden crown upon his brow, but as soon as it touched his head, it turned to lead, growing heavier with each passing day. The prince, once proud and eager, soon found himself bent beneath its weight, unable to walk, unable to rule, consumed by the burden of a throne he had not yet earned. Desperate, he begged The King to fix the crown. The Ascendant only shook his head. _"You sought the power of a ruler,"_ he said. _"But you have not yet learned its cost."_ The prince cast the crown aside, choosing instead to walk among his people, to learn their struggles, to understand their lives. Only when he had earned their trust, their respect, and their loyalty did he return to the throne. And when he placed the crown upon his head once more, it was light as a feather.
